## üîç Loan Approval Predictor: Logistic Regression for Credit Risk Analysis  

**Model:** Logistic Regression  
**Final Accuracy:** 79%  

---

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict the approval of loan applications using a supervised classification approach. By integrating a robust feature engineering pipeline into our traditional logistic regression model, we were able to improve the baseline accuracy significantly‚Äîfrom an initial 70% to 79%. The model utilizes a blend of financial, demographic, and property-related features extracted from a dataset of 553 loan applications.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Our initial analysis focused on data quality, distribution, and inter-variable relationships:
- **Cleanliness:** Checked data types, non-null counts, and removed the `loan_id` column to prevent data leakage.
- **Distributions & Relationships:**  
  - **Pairplots:** Visualized how numerical features such as `applicant_income`, `loan_amount`, and `credit_history` vary with the target variable.

  - **Correlation Heatmap:** Analyzed correlations between numerical features to identify potential multicollinearity.

- **Class Imbalance:** The target distribution was examined to understand the approval versus rejection rates (~70% approved).

## Feature Engineering

A critical phase of this project was the development of an advanced feature engineering pipeline, which contributed to a significant performance gain:

- **Handling Skewed Distributions:**  
  - Applied log transformations on income features (both `applicant_income` and `coapplicant_income`) to reduce skewness.
  
- **Scaling & Normalization:**  
  - Scaled continuous variables such as `loan_amount` and `loan_amount_term` to standardize the range of values.
  
- **Categorical Encoding:**  
  - Performed one-hot encoding on categorical variables (`gender`, `married`, `education`, `self_employed`, `property_area`) to convert them into numeric features.
  
- **Outlier Detection & Removal:**  
  - Identified and handled outliers in financial features to stabilize model training.

These feature transformations not only improved model interpretability but also boosted our prediction accuracy to 79%.

## Modeling

The final model is built using logistic regression with the following workflow:
1. **Data Splitting:** The dataset was split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets with stratification based on `loan_status`.
2. **Model Training:** A logistic regression classifier was trained using our engineered feature set.
3. **Evaluation:** Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, a confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.


### Confusion Matrix

The confusion matrix below shows how well the model distinguishes between approved and rejected loans:

## Feature Importance

A simple bar plot of the trained model's coefficients revealed that **credit_history** and financial indicators (such as **loan_amount** and **applicant_income**) are the most significant predictors for loan approval.

## Future Work

To further enhance model performance, potential next steps include:
- **Additional Feature Engineering:** Incorporating derived ratios (e.g., income-to-loan amount) and interaction features.
- **Model Selection:** Testing ensemble methods such as Random Forests or Gradient Boosting.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing regularization and solver parameters for logistic regression.
- **Robust Validation Techniques:** Implementing cross-validation and more comprehensive error analysis.
