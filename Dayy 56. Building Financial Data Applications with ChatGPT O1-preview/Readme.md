## üåü Project Overview  

This project focuses on building a comprehensive **Financial Data Analysis Tool** that combines **interactive stock price visualizations** with **financial news sentiment analysis**. The tool enables users to explore stock trends over various time horizons and analyze market sentiment using real-time financial news headlines.  

The project is divided into three key components:  
1. **Stock Price Visualization Tool**: Interactive plots for stock prices with options to add technical indicators like SMA, EMA, and Bollinger Bands.  
2. **Customizable Date Range Selection**: Enhanced interactivity with date pickers for flexible time-based analysis.  
3. **Financial News Sentiment Analysis**: Extracts headlines from the Finnhub API and performs sentiment analysis using NLTK's VADER model.

## ‚ú® Key Features  

### **1. Stock Price Visualization Tool**  
- **Interactive Dropdowns**: Select stocks (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, TSLA) and time horizons (e.g., 1M, 3M, 6M).  
- **Technical Indicators**:
  - *Simple Moving Average (SMA)*: Smooths out price data to identify trends.  
  - *Exponential Moving Average (EMA)*: Reacts quickly to recent price changes for trend detection.  
  - *Bollinger Bands*: Measures market volatility with upper/lower bands around a moving average.  
- **Custom Date Pickers**: Analyze stock performance over user-defined date ranges.
