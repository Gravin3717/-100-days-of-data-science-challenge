# DeepSeek-R1 RAG Chatbot: Local PDF Query Assistant

## Overview

This project demonstrates a local AI-powered assistant that processes PDF documents and responds to user queries using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. By leveraging the DeepSeek-R1 (1.5B) model, Ollama for local LLM execution, and LangChain for document processing and semantic search, this solution empowers users to securely query and extract insights from rich PDF contentâ€”without relying on external cloud services.

This solution is designed not only to showcase technical prowess using state-of-the-art components like vector embeddings and Gradio-based interactive interfaces but also to enhance data security and privacy by keeping sensitive documents local.

## Key Features

- **Local LLM Operation:**  
  Run the DeepSeek-R1 model locally via Ollama to generate responses without connecting to external servers.

- **Document Preprocessing & Embedding:**  
  Extracts text from PDFs using PyMuPDF, splits text into manageable chunks with an overlapping context, and generates semantic embeddings using OllamaEmbeddings for accurate retrieval.

- **Vector-Based Semantic Search:**  
  Organizes the generated embeddings using Chroma (a vector database) to allow context-aware searches that go beyond mere keyword matching.

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):**  
  Combines retrieval of salient document chunks with LLM-based text generation to answer user queries accurately based on real content.

- **Interactive Chat Interface:**  
  Employs Gradio to create a user-friendly web application that accepts PDF uploads and text queries, providing immediate AI-driven responses.

- **Local Data Security:**  
  Ensures all document processing and inference occur locally, protecting sensitive data from being exposed to external services.

### Data Pipeline & Processing

1. **PDF Processing:**  
   - *Loader:* `PyMuPDFLoader` extracts raw text from uploaded PDF files.  
   - *Text Splitting:* `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` segments documents into chunks (500 characters with 100-character overlap) for optimal embedding.

2. **Embedding Generation & Storage:**  
   - *Embedding:* `OllamaEmbeddings` converts text chunks into high-dimensional vectors using the DeepSeek-R1 model.
   - *Vector Database:* ChromaDB organizes and persists embeddings in a local directory (`./chroma_db`), enabling efficient semantic retrieval.

3. **RAG Pipeline:**  
   - *Retrieval:* A custom retriever fetches the most contextually relevant document chunks based on the user's query.
   - *Combination:* The retrieved chunks are merged into a coherent text block using a helper function (`combine_docs`).
   - *Response Generation:* The `ollama_llm` function formats the query with context and generates a final, cleaned answer using DeepSeek-R1.

### Core Code Components

| Component                | Functionality                                                             |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `process_pdf(pdf_bytes)` | Loads the PDF, splits text into chunks, generates embeddings, and stores them in a vector store. |
| `combine_docs(docs)`     | Merges retrieved document chunks into a continuous text passage.         |
| `ollama_llm(question, context)` | Formats the prompt and invokes DeepSeek-R1 via Ollama to respond to the query.   |
| `rag_chain(question, text_splitter, vectorstore, retriever)` | Integrates retrieval of context and language model inference for accurate responses.  |
| `ask_question(pdf_bytes, question)` | High-level function that ties together PDF processing and the RAG pipeline.     |
| Gradio Interface         | Provides a web-based user interface to upload PDFs and ask questions interactively. |

- **Ask a Question:**  
Type your question into the text box (e.g., "What are the key findings in the quarterly report?") and submit.

- **Receive an AI-Generated Response:**  
Your question is processed through the RAG pipeline, combining semantic retrieval and language model reasoning to return a detailed answer.

## Insights & Impact

- **Enhanced Document Understanding:**  
The system provides context-aware responses that draw directly from the uploaded PDF content, making it ideal for academic, business, and legal document analysis.

- **Data Privacy and Security:**  
By processing documents locally, the solution ensures that sensitive data is never transmitted over the internet, mitigating privacy risks.

- **Scalability in Application:**  
The modular architecture allows for easy integration of additional features (e.g., predictive analytics, sentiment analysis) and support for various document formats.

- **Democratization of AI Tools:**  
This project demonstrates how advanced AI techniques can be deployed locally with open-source tools, making state-of-the-art technology accessible to a broader audience.
