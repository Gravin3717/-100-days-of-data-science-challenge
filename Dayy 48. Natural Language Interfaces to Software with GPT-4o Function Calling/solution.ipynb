That is, you have a natural language (chat) interface to the software, but any actions that are taken are done using traditional software.\n\n> The **structure behind these super bots or agents**, whether it's Siri, Alexa or Google Home, **includes a vast orchestration layer for skills and knowledge**. These were pre-generative AI. Now you can **plug generative AI into an existing orchestration engine**. I think companies are coming in backwards. They're starting with generative, but not that orchestration framework and cognitive architecture that would allow you to have that agent. **You still require deterministic aspects**. \n\n> If you think of car robotics, you're **not going to use generative AI to turn the steering wheel left and right**. When to turn left or right, and by how much, is very deterministic.\n\nWe'll mostly be using code from the OpenAI API [Function Calling](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling) and [Assistant Tools]([https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/function-calling))
