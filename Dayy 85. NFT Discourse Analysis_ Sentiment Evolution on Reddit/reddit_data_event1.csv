Clumsywon,"I have a couple of layman's thoughts I'm still sorting out. One is that the nft is not the art. The nft is just data. The trading card or artwork or song whatever has its use value in a different media that can be separated from the blockchain. 

I can look at the finest nfts demanding the highest prices and just download or screen capture them. I then have exactly what the owner has except for this abstract concept of the contract.  They say that blockchains are permanent. but a lot of the nfts are tied to particular marketplaces. Like I can get a Wax trading card that only exists in the Wax ecosystem or I can get fine art at Nifty Gateway that is only compatible with the Nifty website. 

What happens to the nft if the organization that hosts it goes bankrupt and closes up shop?  You can say that the unique contract still exists somewhere in the net but what does that mean when the host doesn't exist? If WilliamShatner.io shuts down do I really have anything other than a jpeg of a ham actor with no monetary value?
I'm not trying to be a naysayer here I've spent money in the marketplace and I'm enjoying seeing new projects pop up. It just raises a lot of questions about what value is and how the market might be manipulated.

Also this part I totally don't understand. They say that blockchains can be looked at for verification and proves ownership. But if I look at the ethereum or other blockchain and find the contract what will I actually see? Is the nft content embedded there or is it just a chunk of data with my associated key number?",1610815148.0,226,12yz4p11,NFT

beemoTheAngryRoomba,"im new to NFT but not to crypto, I'd like some help on how to think or perceive the variety of lens on the authenticity of physical goods with NFT, or if that's even a viable use of NFT's

How do you keep a physical collectible authentic with its associated NFT. For example, what if I saw a collectible items 'watermarked' with its NFT, I liked it so much that I went home and literally made a copy of it. It's so similar that unless a person had been sitting down with both versions for a few hours you wouldn't be able to say which one was the first and real one. 

Then i went on an NFT minting site and registered my copy with its own NFT.

Technically now there are two of these collectible items with their own NFT. In that way they are different because they have their own NFT to identify each other, but the physical items aren't unique in its idea and conception.

Or is that out of the realm of NFT and proving authenticity? As in, now there are just two instances of a similar collectible item that are separated by their NFT identity?

I suppose it's just something I haven't really absorbed and realized the intrinsic value of owning a particular NFT versus owning a collectible that happens to have its own NFT. Like I'm not able to associate value with owning a specific NFT, I'm associating the value of the collectible that the NFT is attached with.

Anyways I'm not knocking on NFTs, I am very interested in them and want to learn and understand everything about them! Thanks for any help/advice/suggestions",1613780086.0,23,ac01le60,NFT
Arghmybrain,"I have some questions!

Data storage: 

* Mintable says they are the only ones where you can choose where to store data. Where do other minting places store their date?
* If you let mintable handle it, where do they store their data?
* How future-proof is IPFS?
* If you make your own choice, what's a good secure place to store data? 
* Is there any possible way to change that link to the data in the future in case it somehow goes down?

Pricing:

* Is there a list of the costs other minting place charge?
* Do you always pay per NFT, or only ever per batch?

Other questions:

* What are the downsides to mintable's gasless minting?
* If you'd like to start a collectible set to add to in the future, is gassless minting a good option or should you really use the normal method?
* Do other stores have an upside mintable doesn't?
* Should I wait for l2? I understood it's coming in an update soon. (really confused on the l2 stuff)
* Are there non-ethereum based NFT art/collectible protocols that might be preferable?

tsafa88,"Can anyone explain how royalties work? I can't understand how you can have an 'automatic' royalty based on a percentage (of sale price I assume?)? How can the token be aware of the sale price? Unless it's locked into some proprietary platform but wouldn't that make it far less valuable than a token you can transfer freely?

If there is a royalty based upon sale price, why wouldn't buyers and sellers just understate the sale price?

I can understand how you could have a static/fixed or graduating ETH fee in order to be able to transfer the NFT but how could this be aware of the sale price?

Also what are the favored standards for creating art NFTs that would be most compatible with the best platforms for initial sale and later resales?

""Some NFTs will automatically pay out royalties to their creators when they're sold. This is still a developing concept but it's one of the most powerful. Original owners of EulerBeats Originals earn an 8% royalty every time the NFT is sold on. And some platforms, like Foundation and Zora, support royalties for their artists.

This is completely automatic so creators can just sit back and earn royalties as their work is sold from person to person. At the moment, figuring out royalties is very manual and lacks accuracy  a lot of creators don't get paid what they deserve. If your NFT has a royalty programmed into it, you'll never miss out."" - [https://ethereum.org/en/nft/](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/)

Thanks.

  
Edit: This appears to be the correct answer:

EXAMPLE TIME!

1. You decide to mint and sell your CG teapot NFT on Rarible.

2. When youre creating your listing, you opt for a 20% royalty. (On Rarible, you can choose whatever percentage you want.)

3. A few days later, your item sells for 5 ETH (5 Ether, equivalent to $3,700 USD at the time of writing). NICE!

4. You keep all of that money, minus Raribles commission fees.

5. The following week, the original buyer of your NFT sells it on Raribles secondary marketplace for 6 ETH ($4,400 USD). Since you set a 20% commission, youll make about $880 on that transactioneven though you were not directly involved in it.

6. The next week, the new owner sells your NFT on OpenSea. (All Rarible items can be listed and sold on OpenSea as well.) Unfortunately in this case, you dont get any royalties. Royalties from Rarible (where you minted) are not currently transferrable to OpenSea. Bummer.

Again, royalty systems differ for each marketplace. Take some time to research each platform before deciding where to sell your stuff.

As an obscure musician/composer... over 25 years of original music, 10 albums released that I own 100%.

My thought is, I could turn my work to NFT's....  Connect with my fans from over the years, offering to sell a majority, while I continue performing and marketing the pieces to publisher, film, TV etc.  The benefit not being owning a 'big' artists song...

They add properties like time based access and infusing the NFT with other assets or different layers of properties to make it truly one of a kind.

Hipurisud,"I think that the idea of how do we actually value these natively digital assets is one of the most hardest and overlooked questions and topics. Everyone comes in with a traditional mindset and framework, but that also doesn't make sense. We are undeniably living in a natively digital economy almost. We need to look at unique digital factors to value these assets and in my opinion that comes down to rarity + a story. These are the biggest components that are able to back the asset, provide a maintenance margin and price floor to its value.

GooGadget,"Hey, what up, u/MintableOfficial

 First, I'd like to give props and say thanks on the amazing DD you provided in this post. Very helpful, thank you. Second, I'm new to NFT and this sub and am still learning. That being stated, I have a few questions and scenarios that will not only be helpful to myself,  but may even coin some answers for others. 

1)  If NFT is a digitally modified picture of a photo taken or drawn personally by me w/ original photo or drawing in my possession,  would that increase value? 

I have NFT's of images that I have personally photographed and/ or drawn myself that have been digitally modified and enhanced that I have in my possession.  

2) Do NFT's with self produced soundtracks w/ original audio files add to value? 

I have NFT's with self produced soundtracks with original audio files in my possession. 

3) If buyer is interested, would sending said original photographed photos and/or drawings through mail or sending compressed audio files separately as added bonus be a bad idea? 

I was thinking I would send original photos,  drawings,  and/or soundtracks to heighten the buyers satisfaction and personal experience. 

4)Do you personally think that's a good idea? 

You've obviously got some skin in this game, so I'd like to get your  input and hear your personal thoughts on this. 

Thanks again.",1616030459.0,1,70fct0sw,NFT
