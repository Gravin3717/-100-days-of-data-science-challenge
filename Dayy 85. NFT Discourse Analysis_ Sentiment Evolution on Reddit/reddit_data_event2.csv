AlreadyLiberated,"Ebooks?  Im an author and I sell mostly ebooks. I have books with a publisher but most of the money I make is on my indie titles. Id be interested in offering, lets say, 100 copies of my next book as first editions using NFTs. Maybe the readers would get access to the book before it was available on Kindle, Apple Books, etc. The idea is to make it equivalent to a rare first edition hardback book and charge more for it up front. The books themselves are ePub and Mobi files that get delivered to a readers device. Can anyone explain whether this is in any way viable? How might it work? Id love to be able to do this, especially the part about establishing a marketplace on my website where I could collect a % of resale proceeds.

Burkewitz_Refuses,"Following Beeple and his artwork got me into NFTs. I didnt quite understand the value of what was being sold and re-sold, and have been wracking my brain to figure out why I should care or consider investing. One mans $150,000 animated gif with a digital COA is another mans animated gif he can see on Imgur or Giphy anytime he wants, right? Unless rights to the source material are included with the purchase, NFT art made (and continues to make) very little sense to me. 
 
Your explanation of NFTs value in terms of things like ticket sales and gaming makes way more sense, and it seems like a no-brainer thats where the real functionality will land once the craziness subsides. 
 
As for money laundering, thats kind of inherent in any collectible market. From 2010-2013 the vinyl market (specifically psychedelic records) saw auctions hit stunning highs that have never since been replicated. It took maybe five years for word to spread among the 1%ers in the community to learn it was all part of a Russian money laundering scheme. Thats just vinyl records. Im sure its the same across countless types of collectibles.

For example, if Coca-Cola uses a song off that album for a commercial, and pays the band $1 million, NFT holders are paid out $100k.

THICC_POLLINATORS,">NFTs have big potential for game item marketplaces as the company can issue their items with some royalty rate (ex. 1%), and always get a cut of sales if their game (and trade of its items) takes off.

You wrote so sooooooooo much solid info but gave the Gaming portion of NFTs so little and they are arguably the best use-case to display and point too.

So many folks will miss out thinking a NFT is just a scam link for one of the first tweets. 

**Just in-game skins alone** is such a massive market with established games it would make most boomers heads spin.

NFTs will open up the potential for land investment, normally an investment diversification reserved for the fiscally fortunate with it's extreme price entry point, in the form of fractional shares or some cool af term. 

ENJ + LABS comes to mind, that also, stand alone topic, is enough of a disrupter to have its own entire post but there is no direct mention of NFT and land ownership (not in a video game, actual real estate).

If you want to do well in NFTs, don't study the prices, study art.

23Heart23,"From an art perspective, I was super excited for NFTs when I first heard of them. 

Wow, its a way for talented digital artists - who might otherwise find it difficult to sell/make a living from their creations - to actually make money. 

But after seeing the 2,000th piece of shit three YouTube lessons on Blender- level art piece sell for $20k, it just seemed like the whole thing was going horribly wrong. 

Maybe itll settle down and become what it originally should have been, but the hype around it at the moment means that, rather than genuinely talented artists getting financial recognition, its actually pure crap selling at inflated prices to morons who are only in it to sell to the bigger fool. 

Maybe inevitable, but sad, and like I said I just hope it settles down and becomes what it should have been.  

Maybe thats optimistic though. The tech just does what it does, its the people that determine its value, and markets will reward stupidity as long as stupidity is in demand.",1615120138.0,1,eh2o4,CryptoCurrency

Imagine walking in a bar with XR glasses and seeing someone with a rare NFT AR face filter by a famous artist. You could immediately bring up the NFT contract and offer Crypto to the owner on a decentralised marketplace.",1615121477.0,1,lgk50t7,CryptoCurrency
TheChiefPontiac,"So if I understood it correctly the core problem is that transferring the NFT doesn't automatically transfer ownership. A separate contract is needed for that. 

Could this be circumvented by using the terms and conditions of the primary seller? 
Let's say a company sells NFTs that give access to JPGs on their website. When someone buys such a Token from the company they have to agree to the terms and conditions that read something along the lines of: ""this token cannot be transferred without simultaneously transferring ownership of the right to view the picture on the website"" 

The problem would of course be that any secondary buyers also have to agree to the terms and conditions despite maybe not even knowing of their existence. 
So this is probably not really a working solution but maybe someone who is more versed in American contract law can find a solution for this that doesn't depend on new regulations.",1615121975.0,1,rhylgdz,CryptoCurrency

Also if they make an NFT from this painting what blockchain they can put this onto? Can they put the NFT to two different blockchains and still both of them will be offical?

KingJames0613,"Still trying to wrap my head around some of this, but I think this would be a great application for creating a market or auction, for high-end collectibles. Graded sports cards/comic books, certified memorabilia, rare coins/stamps, etc. could all be traded, bought, and sold with NFTs. Authenticators, grading services, and auction houses could set up the original certified NFT during the process. The fees could be included in the price of buying and selling. Markets would dictate price and physical assets would get exchanged and distributed through these services. A blockchain eBay, of sorts, that I think would be more efficient and more secure.

gunark75,"Coming at this from the side of the artist I think some things will make NFTs an ongoing and ultimate success. 

Firstly it can open up a whole new world of artists able to self exhibit and be in control of their own products, albeit still needing an online gallery to exhibit it. But I can create a piece of artwork, put it up, sell it and build a following. Along with this the purchaser knows they have the real deal, its traceable and theres even ongoing commission for the artist with additional sales. 

And its not just pictorial art. Im primarily a techno musician but have dabbled Im audio visual works that combine art, visuals and sounds that are creatively different to my usual music and is great to make.  For example a triptych with separate soundtracks that play together in unique ways every time. Its down to the viewer how they experience it and its on their own time, not in some exhibition.

Ive not made much because really theres been no easy outlet. But now I can create works, exhibit and hopefully sell them. Frankly Ive more chance with that than I have against the flood of techno released failing. 

So, for me NFTs and defi galleries give me a kind of democratization of creativity with a small chance of making a few pounds along the way. 

Is there a market for them? I believe there is, the market for digital goods is well established and the next step of making items exclusive and even tradable is a logical next step for say, Pokmon, FIFA players or Fortnite skins. 

Also, as soon as media companies realize that they can reissue all their albums / movies / books / etc with unique digital assets they will be all over that.",1615133441.0,1,4h8i3,CryptoCurrency
