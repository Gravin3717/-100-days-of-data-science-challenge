Clumsywon,"I have a couple of layman's thoughts I'm still sorting out. One is that the nft is not the art. The nft is just data. The trading card or artwork or song whatever has its use value in a different media that can be separated from the blockchain. 

I can look at the finest nfts demanding the highest prices and just download or screen capture them. I then have exactly what the owner has except for this abstract concept of the contract.  They say that blockchains are permanent. but a lot of the nfts are tied to particular marketplaces. Like I can get a Wax trading card that only exists in the Wax ecosystem or I can get fine art at Nifty Gateway that is only compatible with the Nifty website. 

What happens to the nft if the organization that hosts it goes bankrupt and closes up shop?  You can say that the unique contract still exists somewhere in the net but what does that mean when the host doesn't exist? If WilliamShatner.io shuts down do I really have anything other than a jpeg of a ham actor with no monetary value?
I'm not trying to be a naysayer here I've spent money in the marketplace and I'm enjoying seeing new projects pop up. It just raises a lot of questions about what value is and how the market might be manipulated.

Also this part I totally don't understand. They say that blockchains can be looked at for verification and proves ownership. But if I look at the ethereum or other blockchain and find the contract what will I actually see? Is the nft content embedded there or is it just a chunk of data with my associated key number?",2021-01-16 16:39:08,226,12yz4p11,NFT,0.8503,very positive

beemoTheAngryRoomba,"im new to NFT but not to crypto, I'd like some help on how to think or perceive the variety of lens on the authenticity of physical goods with NFT, or if that's even a viable use of NFT's

How do you keep a physical collectible authentic with its associated NFT. For example, what if I saw a collectible items 'watermarked' with its NFT, I liked it so much that I went home and literally made a copy of it. It's so similar that unless a person had been sitting down with both versions for a few hours you wouldn't be able to say which one was the first and real one. 

Then i went on an NFT minting site and registered my copy with its own NFT.

Technically now there are two of these collectible items with their own NFT. In that way they are different because they have their own NFT to identify each other, but the physical items aren't unique in its idea and conception.

Or is that out of the realm of NFT and proving authenticity? As in, now there are just two instances of a similar collectible item that are separated by their NFT identity?

I suppose it's just something I haven't really absorbed and realized the intrinsic value of owning a particular NFT versus owning a collectible that happens to have its own NFT. Like I'm not able to associate value with owning a specific NFT, I'm associating the value of the collectible that the NFT is attached with.

Anyways I'm not knocking on NFTs, I am very interested in them and want to learn and understand everything about them! Thanks for any help/advice/suggestions",2021-02-20 00:14:46,23,ac01le60,NFT,0.9861,very positive
Arghmybrain,"I have some questions!

Data storage: 

* Mintable says they are the only ones where you can choose where to store data. Where do other minting places store their date?
* If you let mintable handle it, where do they store their data?
* How future-proof is IPFS?
* If you make your own choice, what's a good secure place to store data? 
* Is there any possible way to change that link to the data in the future in case it somehow goes down?

Pricing:

* Is there a list of the costs other minting place charge?
* Do you always pay per NFT, or only ever per batch?

Other questions:

* What are the downsides to mintable's gasless minting?
* If you'd like to start a collectible set to add to in the future, is gassless minting a good option or should you really use the normal method?
* Do other stores have an upside mintable doesn't?
* Should I wait for l2? I understood it's coming in an update soon. (really confused on the l2 stuff)
* Are there non-ethereum based NFT art/collectible protocols that might be preferable?
* Any other important info that's not included in this how to mint tutorial?",2021-03-05 17:56:24,19,72e7k7j6,NFT,0.8677,very positive

GabeRull,"If you wanted to write your own smart contract for listing an NFT auction, how would you get word out about it to the community? Is there a directory of sorts for the blockchain that guarantees people will see it without doing anything? Or would you want to promote it on reddit or social media or something like that? Also, if I'm writing my own code for the smart contract, might I still want to use mintable for any part of the process? Or would that no longer be necessary?

I am a computer science student and need a project to show potential employers. I was thinking of attempting to sell some art in the form of NFT and writing smart contracts.

tsafa88,"Can anyone explain how royalties work? I can't understand how you can have an 'automatic' royalty based on a percentage (of sale price I assume?)? How can the token be aware of the sale price? Unless it's locked into some proprietary platform but wouldn't that make it far less valuable than a token you can transfer freely?

If there is a royalty based upon sale price, why wouldn't buyers and sellers just understate the sale price?

I can understand how you could have a static/fixed or graduating ETH fee in order to be able to transfer the NFT but how could this be aware of the sale price?

Also what are the favored standards for creating art NFTs that would be most compatible with the best platforms for initial sale and later resales?

""Some NFTs will automatically pay out royalties to their creators when they're sold. This is still a developing concept but it's one of the most powerful. Original owners of EulerBeats Originals earn an 8% royalty every time the NFT is sold on. And some platforms, like Foundation and Zora, support royalties for their artists.

This is completely automatic so creators can just sit back and earn royalties as their work is sold from person to person. At the moment, figuring out royalties is very manual and lacks accuracy  a lot of creators don't get paid what they deserve. If your NFT has a royalty programmed into it, you'll never miss out."" - [https://ethereum.org/en/nft/](https://ethereum.org/en/nft/)

Thanks.

  
Edit: This appears to be the correct answer:

EXAMPLE TIME!

1. You decide to mint and sell your CG teapot NFT on Rarible.

2. When youre creating your listing, you opt for a 20% royalty. (On Rarible, you can choose whatever percentage you want.)

3. A few days later, your item sells for 5 ETH (5 Ether, equivalent to $3,700 USD at the time of writing). NICE!

4. You keep all of that money, minus Raribles commission fees.

5. The following week, the original buyer of your NFT sells it on Raribles secondary marketplace for 6 ETH ($4,400 USD). Since you set a 20% commission, youll make about $880 on that transactioneven though you were not directly involved in it.

6. The next week, the new owner sells your NFT on OpenSea. (All Rarible items can be listed and sold on OpenSea as well.) Unfortunately in this case, you dont get any royalties. Royalties from Rarible (where you minted) are not currently transferrable to OpenSea. Bummer.

Again, royalty systems differ for each marketplace. Take some time to research each platform before deciding where to sell your stuff.

Big Question for me

As an obscure musician/composer... over 25 years of original music, 10 albums released that I own 100%.  Over last 2 years, 3 hours of unreleased compositions I am offering to film and TV.... and truck loads of strange little noises and bits, samples that could be bought to add to someone elses score.      
Is NFT a potential route, if my name and work is not widely established, but I am working hard to promote?  

My thought is, I could turn my work to NFT's....  Connect with my fans from over the years, offering to sell a majority, while I continue performing and marketing the pieces to publisher, film, TV etc.  The benefit not being owning a 'big' artists song... Instead, the potential of it becoming worth much more, if used in film, tv and new media?

Everyone comes in with a traditional mindset and framework, but that also doesn't make sense. We are undeniably living in a natively digital economy almost. We need to look at unique digital factors to value these assets and in my opinion that comes down to rarity + a story. These are the biggest components that are able to back the asset, provide a maintenance margin and price floor to its value.

 First, I'd like to give props and say thanks on the amazing DD you provided in this post. Very helpful, thank you. Second, I'm new to NFT and this sub and am still learning. That being stated, I have a few questions and scenarios that will not only be helpful to myself,  but may even coin some answers for others. 

1)  If NFT is a digitally modified picture of a photo taken or drawn personally by me w/ original photo or drawing in my possession,  would that increase value? 

I have NFT's of images that I have personally photographed and/ or drawn myself that have been digitally modified and enhanced that I have in my possession.  

2) Do NFT's with self produced soundtracks w/ original audio files add to value? 

I have NFT's with self produced soundtracks with original audio files in my possession. 

3) If buyer is interested, would sending said original photographed photos and/or drawings through mail or sending compressed audio files separately as added bonus be a bad idea? 

I was thinking I would send original photos,  drawings,  and/or soundtracks to heighten the buyers satisfaction and personal experience. 

4)Do you personally think that's a good idea? 

You've obviously got some skin in this game, so I'd like to get your  input and hear your personal thoughts on this.

Burkewitz_Refuses,"Following Beeple and his artwork got me into NFTs. I didnt quite understand the value of what was being sold and re-sold, and have been wracking my brain to figure out why I should care or consider investing. One mans $150,000 animated gif with a digital COA is another mans animated gif he can see on Imgur or Giphy anytime he wants, right? Unless rights to the source material are included with the purchase, NFT art made (and continues to make) very little sense to me. 
 
Your explanation of NFTs value in terms of things like ticket sales and gaming makes way more sense, and it seems like a no-brainer thats where the real functionality will land once the craziness subsides. 
 
As for money laundering, thats kind of inherent in any collectible market. From 2010-2013 the vinyl market (specifically psychedelic records) saw auctions hit stunning highs that have never since been replicated. It took maybe five years for word to spread among the 1%ers in the community to learn it was all part of a Russian money laundering scheme. Thats just vinyl records. Im sure its the same across countless types of collectibles.

As a gallery manager and art collector, my advice is buy only art you personally love. If it brings you joy, it has value. If you don't like the look of CryptoPunks, don't buy em! If you are into psychedelic art, buy that...

If you want to do well in NFTs, don't study the prices, study art.

# The beauty of developing an appreciation of art is that it is something you will take with you forever and that nobody can take away from you. The knowledge will not fall in value over time and will enrich your life in ways you cannot possibly imagine.

23Heart23,"From an art perspective, I was super excited for NFTs when I first heard of them. 

Wow, its a way for talented digital artists - who might otherwise find it difficult to sell/make a living from their creations - to actually make money. 

But after seeing the 2,000th piece of shit three YouTube lessons on Blender- level art piece sell for $20k, it just seemed like the whole thing was going horribly wrong. 

Maybe itll settle down and become what it originally should have been, but the hype around it at the moment means that, rather than genuinely talented artists getting financial recognition, its actually pure crap selling at inflated prices to morons who are only in it to sell to the bigger fool. 

Maybe inevitable, but sad, and like I said I just hope it settles down and becomes what it should have been.  

Maybe thats optimistic though. The tech just does what it does, its the people that determine its value, and markets will reward stupidity as long as stupidity is in demand.",2021-03-07 12:28:58,1,eh2o4,CryptoCurrency,-0.802,very negative

TheChiefPontiac,"So if I understood it correctly the core problem is that transferring the NFT doesn't automatically transfer ownership. A separate contract is needed for that. 

Could this be circumvented by using the terms and conditions of the primary seller? 
Let's say a company sells NFTs that give access to JPGs on their website. When someone buys such a Token from the company they have to agree to the terms and conditions that read something along the lines of: ""this token cannot be transferred without simultaneously transferring ownership of the right to view the picture on the website"" 

The problem would of course be that any secondary buyers also have to agree to the terms and conditions despite maybe not even knowing of their existence. 
So this is probably not really a working solution but maybe someone who is more versed in American contract law can find a solution for this that doesn't depend on new regulations.",2021-03-07 12:59:35,1,rhylgdz,CryptoCurrency,0.5472,very positive

Authenticators, grading services, and auction houses could set up the original certified NFT during the process. The fees could be included in the price of buying and selling. Markets would dictate price and physical assets would get exchanged and distributed through these services. A blockchain eBay, of sorts, that I think would be more efficient and more secure.

gunark75,"Coming at this from the side of the artist I think some things will make NFTs an ongoing and ultimate success. 

Firstly it can open up a whole new world of artists able to self exhibit and be in control of their own products, albeit still needing an online gallery to exhibit it. But I can create a piece of artwork, put it up, sell it and build a following. Along with this the purchaser knows they have the real deal, its traceable and theres even ongoing commission for the artist with additional sales. 

And its not just pictorial art. Im primarily a techno musician but have dabbled Im audio visual works that combine art, visuals and sounds that are creatively different to my usual music and is great to make.  For example a triptych with separate soundtracks that play together in unique ways every time. Its down to the viewer how they experience it and its on their own time, not in some exhibition.

Ive not made much because really theres been no easy outlet. But now I can create works, exhibit and hopefully sell them. Frankly Ive more chance with that than I have against the flood of techno released failing. 

So, for me NFTs and defi galleries give me a kind of democratization of creativity with a small chance of making a few pounds along the way. 

Is there a market for them? I believe there is, the market for digital goods is well established and the next step of making items exclusive and even tradable is a logical next step for say, Pokmon, FIFA players or Fortnite skins. 

Also, as soon as media companies realize that they can reissue all their albums / movies / books / etc with unique digital assets they will be all over that.",2021-03-07 16:10:41,1,4h8i3,CryptoCurrency,0.9823,very positive

People who held had conviction in this tech held strong. They definitely deserve every bit of wealth.

BAYC holders will get airdropped ape-coin.

Theres gonna be a BAYC game to spend the coins.

Exclusive merchandise for holders. (Think high end brand in infant stage like Supreme or LV) collecting these physical items will be worth a lot in future.

Brand recognition or Clout if you choose to rock your nft as a pfp. 

For exclusivity theres so much going on behind the scenes. This brand is only 9 months old with over a 4 billion dollar in sales. The sales volume on BAYC exceeds many large companys that are recognize today.

BAYC is building physical clubs exclusive for ape holders. Starting in Miami.

After the NFT NYC event there is private BAYC yacht party. 

Access to private discords where ppl discover up and coming projects and talk tech. 

Before NFTs people would pay millions to be in private clubs just to associate with other like minded folks. This is no different than the billionaires & millionaires who spend hundreds of thousands to access a golf course or whatever may be.

Call it what you want, JPEG or membership pass.. BAYC is a club and anyone with an ape is a member. 

Im not a member of BAYC so Im sure Im missing out points of value.

How does your opinion even matter here? There are only 10,000 apes (passes), all that will ever be. All it takes is a few people who can afford it to be a part of it. It's not even about the jpeg or ""services"", it's about enough social consensus to make something hold value across time and this is true for anything, especially for social networks. Something that's also overlooked is that such assets move independent of markets.

>And most of the time its not the market thats setting these prices. Theyre usually inorganically inflated.

Isn't that a little hypocritical when most of cryptocurrency space is pumped up VC bags at the cost of idiots such as ourselves. Anyone buying into fucking Geth forks like AVAX should realize this but do they?

>This is exactly why NFT like Bored Apes are so hated. I think the only valuable thing about Bored Apes is the access to exclusive places and contacts but that's it.

They are hated only because you plebs are priced out and won't ever consider owning one or forming a DAO to fractionalize one. You think exclusivity does not matter? Boy do you even live on social media? High net worth individuals dictate social trends, they make the next cool thing, they put social pressure on others to do the same. For such peeps NFTs are a great means of showcasing their status as well as some form of identity. Twitter sees it, Facebook sees it, Youtube sees it when will you guys?

As much as I don't like their use in gaming - at least the game acts as an authority enforcing ownership.  If a game character, skin, item, etc is an NFT you won't get the in game benefit by taking screen shots or minting your own rip off copy.

Most of them will likely deflate in value to being worth nothing in the near-term. However, over time, we will likely find that they end up with some utility, which could drive their price back up. I like to think of the NFT craze that's going on right now similar to the .com bubble popping. Some companies managed to make it out, many did not. It's going to be very difficult to choose the winners correctly, but there will be plenty of people that will catch enough of them to make a lot of profit.

RichardStaschy,"I have a hard time understanding NFTs because I keep remembering something similar that happened around 2000.

Short version of a long story.

Wizards of the Coat created this cardboard game called Magic the Gathering. Some of the cardboard cards are worth lots of money. In early 2000s, Wizards pushed a digital version of the game called Magic Online, thay claim it will be the future of Magic. And yes some of those digital cards was worth lots of money. Then less then 10 years ago (maybe sooner) Wizards pushes a NEW ONLINE FORMAT called Arena - and the Magic Online cards value crashed.

I thought it was stupid back in 2000 because I saw the Online cards as JPEGs.

As for NFTs all I'm seeing is silly JPEGs. I believe the value is based on ETH (or whatever chain it's attached to). 

I believe the NFTs are rising the value of ETH and its gas. 

I do expect this NFT thing will crash if 90% of its utility is stupid JPEGs... so far I don't see any awesome use unless I play a game that allows my only NFT to be displayed or used (cool maybe but nothing that I would sink more then 50 dollars.)",2022-02-02 15:48:08,1,4728gi,CryptoCurrency,0.2853,somewhat positive

Calivan,"There is a middle of the road on this, what has happened with NFTs is a shame to an extent. They are more than art, way more. The focus on art is because it is the easiest vein for the general public to understand and utilize the technology.

My opinion is that art NFTs are like trading cards. People can trade them at a perceived value. Nothing wrong with this. Magic the Gathering follows the same concept, these cards can be duplicated/forged as ""proxies"". These proxies can be nearly identical in look and feel, but they do not carry the same value. The authentic cards can trade for tens of thousands.

That said the where the value to me should come into question is how the art is stored. On the blockchain, in a decenterized storage (that the token owner controls), or centralized storage. If at any point the owner of the token doesn't control the art, specifically in centralized storage, then that token should be near worthless. As the art can go away at any moment and they just control some meta data on a chain.

The other consideration is authenticity and viability. Art based NFTs created outside of the copyright holder are a real issue, functionally the same as forged art. In terms of viability, the developer community and corporations will build solutions around specific blockchains. Those chains not adopted by these groups will see their NFTs lose value or even become worthless. Even worse some may just crease to exist due to project and community abandonment.

So my point here is don't make the argument that art NFTs are not worth their precieved value. Let the community determine the value and you decided if you want to participate or not. I choose not to as I see a lot of risk at this point, but I see the value as concept matures.",2022-02-02 16:28:57,1,h67pw,CryptoCurrency,0.2484,somewhat positive

Eggmud11,"This was sourced from Google Trends. This is not indicative of the general interest in NFTs, only the search volume for the keyword NFT. 

People who know what NFTs are generally wont search the keyword NFT by itself because the search intent behind that keyword is informational and broad - people are looking for a definition or a general overview of the concept. 

If there was a decline in the overall volume of NFT *related* searches, then maybe theres a case to be made that NFT interest is rapidly dwindling.

There are alternative hypotheses that could be made with this data, like that the general public has become more educated in NFTs.",2022-03-20 19:42:10,1,6bv188rn,CryptoCurrency,0.8176,very positive
