MochiJump,"I think NFTs make a ton of sense for ticketing/pass systems and claim/receipt systems. They have potential even for use cases like trouble tickets, and countless more that I can't think of.

The way the world is highlighting using NFTs with these extremely expensive ""collectables"" kinda hurts. It seems to be a hamfisted and incorrect usage of NFTs. On one hand the term NFT is becoming more and more mainstream, but on the other hand the mainstream now relates NFTs to scams and you can't really blame them. It may be a net positive for future adoption (remains to be seen), but in the short term it definitely feels gross and makes talking about the technology to someone with a ""passing knowledge"" extremely difficult",1643775116.0,122,1vjinn3v,CryptoCurrency

The bored ape brand launched its NFT collection in April  21 (10 months ago) for a mint cost of .08 ether. Took days to sell out and many people minted and sold for quick profits. 

These Jpegs are scarce collectables with verifiable sources. A collectors wet dream. 

People who held had conviction in this tech held strong. They definitely deserve every bit of wealth.

BAYC holders will get airdropped ape-coin.

Theres gonna be a BAYC game to spend the coins.

Exclusive merchandise for holders. (Think high end brand in infant stage like Supreme or LV) collecting these physical items will be worth a lot in future.

Brand recognition or Clout if you choose to rock your nft as a pfp. 

For exclusivity theres so much going on behind the scenes. This brand is only 9 months old with over a 4 billion dollar in sales. The sales volume on BAYC exceeds many large companys that are recognize today.

BAYC is building physical clubs exclusive for ape holders. Starting in Miami.

After the NFT NYC event there is private BAYC yacht party. 

Access to private discords where ppl discover up and coming projects and talk tech. 

Before NFTs people would pay millions to be in private clubs just to associate with other like minded folks. This is no different than the billionaires & millionaires who spend hundreds of thousands to access a golf course or whatever may be.

Call it what you want, JPEG or membership pass.. BAYC is a club and anyone with an ape is a member.

How does your opinion even matter here? There are only 10,000 apes (passes), all that will ever be. All it takes is a few people who can afford it to be a part of it. It's not even about the jpeg or ""services"", it's about enough social consensus to make something hold value across time and this is true for anything, especially for social networks. Something that's also overlooked is that such assets move independent of markets.

>And most of the time its not the market thats setting these prices. Theyre usually inorganically inflated.

Isn't that a little hypocritical when most of cryptocurrency space is pumped up VC bags at the cost of idiots such as ourselves. Anyone buying into fucking Geth forks like AVAX should realize this but do they?

>This is exactly why NFT like Bored Apes are so hated. I think the only valuable thing about Bored Apes is the access to exclusive places and contacts but that's it.

They are hated only because you plebs are priced out and won't ever consider owning one or forming a DAO to fractionalize one. You think exclusivity does not matter? Boy do you even live on social media? High net worth individuals dictate social trends, they make the next cool thing, they put social pressure on others to do the same. For such peeps NFTs are a great means of showcasing their status as well as some form of identity. Twitter sees it, Facebook sees it, Youtube sees it when will you guys?

Here the technology fails to do what it intends to, which is create digital ownership.

As much as I don't like their use in gaming - at least the game acts as an authority enforcing ownership.  If a game character, skin, item, etc is an NFT you won't get the in game benefit by taking screen shots or minting your own rip off copy.

Most of them will likely deflate in value to being worth nothing in the near-term. However, over time, we will likely find that they end up with some utility, which could drive their price back up. I like to think of the NFT craze that's going on right now similar to the .com bubble popping. Some companies managed to make it out, many did not. It's going to be very difficult to choose the winners correctly, but there will be plenty of people that will catch enough of them to make a lot of profit.

RichardStaschy,"I have a hard time understanding NFTs because I keep remembering something similar that happened around 2000.

Short version of a long story.

Wizards of the Coat created this cardboard game called Magic the Gathering. Some of the cardboard cards are worth lots of money. In early 2000s, Wizards pushed a digital version of the game called Magic Online, thay claim it will be the future of Magic. And yes some of those digital cards was worth lots of money. Then less then 10 years ago (maybe sooner) Wizards pushes a NEW ONLINE FORMAT called Arena - and the Magic Online cards value crashed.

I thought it was stupid back in 2000 because I saw the Online cards as JPEGs.

As for NFTs all I'm seeing is silly JPEGs. I believe the value is based on ETH (or whatever chain it's attached to). 

I believe the NFTs are rising the value of ETH and its gas. 

I do expect this NFT thing will crash if 90% of its utility is stupid JPEGs... so far I don't see any awesome use unless I play a game that allows my only NFT to be displayed or used (cool maybe but nothing that I would sink more then 50 dollars.)",1643816888.0,1,4728gi,CryptoCurrency

Calivan,"There is a middle of the road on this, what has happened with NFTs is a shame to an extent. They are more than art, way more. The focus on art is because it is the easiest vein for the general public to understand and utilize the technology.

My opinion is that art NFTs are like trading cards. People can trade them at a perceived value. Nothing wrong with this. Magic the Gathering follows the same concept, these cards can be duplicated/forged as ""proxies"". These proxies can be nearly identical in look and feel, but they do not carry the same value. The authentic cards can trade for tens of thousands.

That said the where the value to me should come into question is how the art is stored. On the blockchain, in a decenterized storage (that the token owner controls), or centralized storage. If at any point the owner of the token doesn't control the art, specifically in centralized storage, then that token should be near worthless. As the art can go away at any moment and they just control some meta data on a chain.

The other consideration is authenticity and viability. Art based NFTs created outside of the copyright holder are a real issue, functionally the same as forged art. In terms of viability, the developer community and corporations will build solutions around specific blockchains. Those chains not adopted by these groups will see their NFTs lose value or even become worthless. Even worse some may just crease to exist due to project and community abandonment.

So my point here is don't make the argument that art NFTs are not worth their precieved value. Let the community determine the value and you decided if you want to participate or not. I choose not to as I see a lot of risk at this point, but I see the value as concept matures.",1643819337.0,1,h67pw,CryptoCurrency
