Ive been in NFTs for 2 months now. Some of the brightest minds are in nfts (not necessarily all in on nfts but just open minded about it and adding to the dialogue). 

The very reasons why people were drawn to crypto vs tradfi, now people are making those same close minded mistakes on other parts of crypto like NFTs. It's sad because people are making assumptions without even dipping their toes in. Crypto natives should all be united in pushing this space forward but instead we get people fighting each other.

TomOkihara,"Alright its hilarious that youre trashing NFTs and then calling for Altcoin season. Have fun holding your ADA lol

There was an explosion of interest in NFTs last summer (JPEG Summer) and its absolutely decreasing, youre not wrong. 

JPEG Summer was super fun and certainly put NFTs in the mainstream conversation. With a variety of things taking place, and with time just moving forward, interest has shifted toward other things. 

Whats unfortunate is that NFTs get the bad rep for how people use them. You could remove the technology entirely and the same people would be pulling the same scams in the same way. Its just packaged differently. 

Play 2 Earn is gaining a lot of momentum and is becoming a buzz phrase. Metaverses are gaining popularity and blockchain gaming is highly anticipated. NFTs arent going anywhere.

Eggmud11,"This was sourced from Google Trends. This is not indicative of the general interest in NFTs, only the search volume for the keyword NFT. 

People who know what NFTs are generally wont search the keyword NFT by itself because the search intent behind that keyword is informational and broad - people are looking for a definition or a general overview of the concept. 

If there was a decline in the overall volume of NFT *related* searches, then maybe theres a case to be made that NFT interest is rapidly dwindling.

There are alternative hypotheses that could be made with this data, like that the general public has become more educated in NFTs.",1647805330.0,1,6bv188rn,CryptoCurrency
