## 🌟 Project Overview  

Every marketing campaign aims to **convert engagement into revenue**, but how do we measure success?  

This project analyzes a **multi-channel marketing campaign** to evaluate its **effectiveness, ROI, and customer engagement**. Using **Tableau for visualization** and **Excel for data preprocessing**, I built a **dynamic dashboard** that enables marketers to make data-driven decisions.  

🚀 **Key Highlights:**  
✔️ **Analyzed campaign effectiveness** across multiple channels  
✔️ **Evaluated customer engagement trends** and conversion rates  
✔️ **Identified high-performing campaigns** to optimize future marketing strategies  
✔️ **Built an interactive Tableau dashboard** for real-time data exploration
