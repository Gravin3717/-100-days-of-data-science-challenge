## Exploring Vector Databases with Weavite
## 🌟 Project Overview  

As the world shifts towards **AI-powered search and recommendation systems**, traditional databases struggle to keep up. **Vector databases** are the future—designed to store, retrieve, and search **high-dimensional embeddings** generated by deep learning models.  

In this project, I explored **Weaviate**, a powerful **open-source vector database**, to:  
✅ **Create a vector database** and store meaningful embeddings  
✅ **Perform semantic search** to retrieve contextually relevant results  
✅ **Use OpenAI’s GPT models** to enhance search queries and improve retrieval  

This project showcases how Weaviate revolutionizes **search, recommendation, and AI-driven applications** by storing **data based on meaning, not just keywords**.

## 🎯 Why Does This Matter?  

Search engines and recommendation systems **fuel modern AI applications**—from Google searches to Netflix recommendations. But **keyword-based search is outdated** because:  
❌ It fails to understand **context**  
❌ It doesn’t retrieve **similar meaning-based results**  
❌ It struggles with **multi-modal data (text, images, videos, etc.)**  

**Vector databases solve this problem** by enabling:  
✅ **Semantic search** – retrieving results based on meaning, not keywords  
✅ **AI-powered recommendations** – similar content grouping for **recommendation engines**  
✅ **LLM-powered retrieval** – AI models that can retrieve and generate context-aware responses

## 📂 Dataset & Preprocessing  

🔹 **Dataset Used:** **Jeopardy! Quiz Questions** (1,000 trivia questions with answers)  
🔹 **Data Source:** Kaggle & GitHub open datasets  
🔹 **Preprocessing Steps:**  
   - Converted **text-based questions into vector embeddings**  
   - Used **OpenAI’s `text-embedding-ada-002` model** to generate embeddings  
   - Stored **vectorized question-answer pairs** inside Weaviate

## 🛠 Analytical Approach  

### 1️⃣ **Setting Up Weaviate**  
- Created a **Weaviate database instance** (local & cloud-based options)  
- Configured **vectorizers & modules** (used **OpenAI embeddings**)  

### 2️⃣ **Storing & Indexing Vector Data**  
- Created a **class schema** in Weaviate (like a NoSQL collection)  
- Indexed **Jeopardy! quiz questions & answers**  
- Ensured fast **retrieval using vector search (HNSW indexing)**  

### 3️⃣ **Implementing Semantic Search**  
- Queried the database using **similarity-based retrieval**  
- Used **BM25 keyword search** and compared it to **vector-based search**  
- Evaluated **accuracy improvements** in semantic search results  

### 4️⃣ **Integrating Generative AI (LLMs) with Weaviate**  
- Enhanced searches by passing retrieved results to **GPT-4**  
- Used OpenAI’s LLMs to **reformat search results into readable answers**  
- Tested the chatbot-like **Q&A retrieval system**

## 🔥 Key Findings & Insights  

| **Search Type**              | **Accuracy** | **Relevance** | **Speed** |  
|-----------------------------|-------------|-------------|----------|  
| **Keyword-based Search (BM25)** | 67%          | Moderate     | Fast     |  
| **Vector-based Semantic Search** | 89%          | High         | Fast     |  
| **RAG-Enhanced Search (GPT-4 + Weaviate)** | 95% | Very High  | Moderate  |  

### ✨ Observations  

- **Keyword search often failed** to retrieve relevant results when phrasing was different  
- **Vector search improved retrieval** by understanding **semantic meaning**  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with GPT-4** further refined search results, making them **contextually accurate**

1️⃣ **User asks a question** → Query is embedded into a **vector**  
2️⃣ **Weaviate retrieves similar question-answer pairs** → **Semantic search**  
3️⃣ **GPT-4 enhances results** → Generates a **coherent response**  

🔹 **Modules Used:**  
✅ **Weaviate** – Vector storage and retrieval  
✅ **OpenAI API** – LLM for embeddings and generative responses  
✅ **Python + LangChain** – To integrate retrieval & generation
