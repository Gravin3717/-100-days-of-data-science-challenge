📌 **Created word cloud visualizations** to identify key words.  

### **2️⃣ Text Preprocessing**  
📌 Used **TF-IDF Vectorization** to extract features from text.  
📌 Considered **unigrams & bigrams** for better context understanding.  

### **3️⃣ Feature Engineering**  
📌 Extracted **character count, word count, and average word length**.  
📌 Combined **TF-IDF scores with text-based statistical features**.  

### **4️⃣ Model Training & Evaluation**  
📌 Used **Random Forest Classifier** for sentiment prediction.  
📌 Evaluated model performance using **Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy**.  
📌 Visualized results using a **Confusion Matrix**.  

### **5️⃣ Feature Importance Analysis**  
📌 Identified the **most impactful words** for classification.  
📌 Examined how words like "bad," "worst," and "great" influenced predictions.

## 📊 Key Results  

| **Metric**  | **Score**  |  
|------------|-----------|  
| **Accuracy** | **79%** |  
| **Precision (Positive Sentiment)** | **0.76** |  
| **Recall (Positive Sentiment)** | **0.80** |  
| **F1-Score (Overall)** | **0.78** |  

### ✨ Observations  

📌 **"Bad" and "worst" were the strongest indicators of negative sentiment.**  
📌 **"Great" and "excellent" were key predictors of positive sentiment.**  
📌 The **Random Forest model performed well**, achieving **79% accuracy**.
