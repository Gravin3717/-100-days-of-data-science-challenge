# NASA Planetary Exploration Budget Analysis in SQL
*Unveiling NASA's planetary exploration spending patterns over the decades*

## üöÄ Project Overview  
This project explores NASA's planetary exploration budgets using SQL, analyzing costs across missions, destinations, and time. By leveraging inflation-adjusted data, we gain insights into the financial priorities of NASA's space programs and the economic factors influencing space exploration.

**Key Objectives:**
- Calculate total and inflation-adjusted costs for all planetary missions.
- Identify the most expensive mission and destination.
- Analyze spending trends over time and across destinations.
- Explore budget allocation by mission components (e.g., spacecraft, operations).

## üîß Key SQL Queries and Insights  

### 1. Total Cost of All Missions (Inflation Adjusted)  
We calculated the total inflation-adjusted cost for all planetary missions:  

```
SELECT SUM("cost_MUSD" * inflation_adjustment) AS adjusted_total_cost_MUSD
FROM mission_budgets
LEFT JOIN inflation
USING (fiscal_year);
```

**Result:**  
NASA has spent approximately **$195 billion (adjusted)** on planetary exploration.

### 2. Most Expensive Mission  
To find the most expensive mission in NASA's history:  
```
SELECT mission, SUM("cost_MUSD" * inflation_adjustment) AS adjusted_total_cost_MUSD
FROM mission_budgets
LEFT JOIN inflation
USING (fiscal_year)
GROUP BY mission
ORDER BY adjusted_total_cost_MUSD DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

**Result:**  
The **Viking program** was NASA's most expensive mission, costing approximately **$7.2 billion (adjusted)**.

### 3. Spending Trends Over Time  
To analyze how NASA's spending evolved over time:  
```
SELECT fiscal_year, SUM("cost_MUSD" * inflation_adjustment) AS adjusted_total_cost_MUSD
FROM mission_budgets
LEFT JOIN inflation
USING (fiscal_year)
GROUP BY fiscal_year
ORDER BY fiscal_year;
```

We visualized this data using a bar plot:  

**Insights:**  
- Peaks in spending correspond to major projects like Apollo and Viking missions.
- Budget fluctuations reflect economic conditions and political priorities.

### 4. Spending by Destination  
To identify which destinations received the most funding:  

```
SELECT destination, SUM("cost_MUSD" * inflation_adjustment) AS adjusted_total_cost_MUSD
FROM mission_budgets
LEFT JOIN inflation USING (fiscal_year)
LEFT JOIN mission_details USING (mission)
GROUP BY destination
ORDER BY adjusted_total_cost_MUSD DESC;
```

**Results:**  
| **Destination**       | **Total Cost (Adjusted)** |
|------------------------|---------------------------|
| Mars                  | $31.7 billion            |
| Outer Planets         | $21.8 billion            |
| The Moon              | $12.9 billion            |

### 5. Spending by Mission Component (Cost Type)  
To determine which parts of a mission are most expensive:  
```
SELECT cost_type, AVG("cost_MUSD") AS average_cost
FROM mission_budgets
GROUP BY cost_type
ORDER BY average_cost DESC;
```

**Results:**  
| **Cost Type**                  | **Average Cost (MUSD)** |
|--------------------------------|-------------------------|
| Implementation (incl LV)       | $185.75                |
| Development (incl LV)          | $104.88                |
| Formulation                    | $102.18                |

### 6. Programs with Multiple Destinations  
To find NASA programs with missions targeting multiple destinations:  
```
SELECT program, COUNT(DISTINCT destination) AS num_destinations
FROM mission_details
GROUP BY program
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT destination) > 1;
```

**Programs with Multiple Destinations:**  
1. Discovery Program ‚Äì 14 destinations  
2. Mariner Program ‚Äì 6 destinations
