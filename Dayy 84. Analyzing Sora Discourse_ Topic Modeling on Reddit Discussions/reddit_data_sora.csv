TheBluestBerries,"You know, I've had this discussion over airbrushes, over early image software tools, over the switch from 2D to 3D games, over the first real use of CGI, it never ends.

Ultimately, art creation is about communication. Communication requires language. And what artists do is create that language through the development of their personal style, their medium, their methods and so on.

Movies, video games, big advertising campaigns, they go through hundreds if not more pieces of concept art to gradually refine a vision into a final product that matches exactly what the art director had in mind.

AI generators, even spectacular ones like Sora don't do that. They produce wonderful results that can be nudged a bit but have to be accepted 'as is'. They don't produce results from the bottom of an artists soul or based on tons of market research or psychological profiling. They produce ""good enough to use"" if that's enough for your purposes.

Will it usurp jobs? Absolutely, there's a whole segment of designers that don't have a style of their own. They're just churning out 'good enough' for superficial purposes like social media post headers that get forgotten in hours or days.

But there's also a whole group of people who see this as little more than the next airbrush. I'm already cheating in my work because cheating is part of the job. I have a whole organized folder full of props, facial expressions and other components of past work of mine that I frequently reuse. You'd better believe I'll be the first to use AI that can produce work that looks like my work to let me produce more work.

We're also looking into training colleagues how to use AI as a virtual work buddy. Instead of replacing humans with AI, we're training humans to be more productive thanks to AI. And you'd better believe we're running into just as many limitations in that process as we are opportunities.

Ultimately, the people who get hurt worst by AI will be the people who work in a creative field without having a creative style of their own. The writers who can write grammatically correct copy but don't have a voice of their own that sets them apart. The people who can illustrate the most generic possible stuff in Illustrator or Procreate, but wouldn't be able to iterate through concepts to nail a client briefing down perfectly. The people who proudly show off the result of a Blender tutorial but don't really know how to make something original.

Property owners (mostly old people) take out equity release loans on their now multi-million dollar homes and liquidate their 401ks. Banks give them generous loans to snap up all property and land. Retire in luxury.

Older people (and those who inherit) become the primary consumer class. 90% of new jobs created are in healthcare.

im_thatoneguy,"I'm going to offer a different take.  It won't replace bespoke VFX work entirely any time soon.   I'm going to raise an example that seems extremely random but is indicative of why it's just not going to happen anytime soon.   Adobe, Apple and Google all have incredible AI driven depth of field systems now for blurring your photos.   Adobe and Apple let you add cat-eye vignetting to your bokeh.  None of them offer anamorphic blur.

All they have to do is add an oval black and white texture to their DOF kernel and they could offer cinematic anamorphic blur.  But none of them did it.  Why? Because we're too small of a priority.  People want a blurry photo of their cat.  Your average 10 year old doesn't know to demand anamorphic bokeh.  And that's something that's easy to add.  We're talking like an intern inconvenienced for a week.  Trillion dollar companies can't add a different bokeh kernel.

AI everything hits the same wall over and over again.  It very effectively creates **something** that looks plausible at first glance. They're getting better and better with consistency at creating **something** with more and more self consistency\*\*.\*\*  But as soon as you want to tweak anything at all it falls apart completely.   For instance Midjourney has been improving by leaps and bounds for the last 2 years.  But if you select a dog in an image and say ""imagine a calico cat"" you're unlikely to get a cat.  Or you'll at best get it 1:10 times.

There is amazing technology that's been developed out there.  Amazing research papers that come out every year with mind blowing technology.  But it hardly ever gets turned into a product usable in production.

And speaking as someone who directed a few dozen commercials during COVID using nothing but Getty Stock... trying to piece together a narrative using footage that can't be directed very explicitly is more time consuming and frustrating than just grabbing a camera and some actors and filming it.  And there isn't an incentive to give us the control and tools that we want and need for VFX tasks.

Not because it's not possible, but because we're too niche of a problem to get someone to customize the technology to address film maker's needs.  As a last example I'll use 24p.   The DVX100 was one of the first prosumer cameras to shoot in 24 frames per second.  That's all that was needed from the camera manufacturers... just shoot in 24hz.  But nobody would do it. Everything was 30p/60i etc. The average consumer wasn't demanding it.  The film making community was small and niche.  And it was incredibly difficult to convince Panasonic or Sony to bother.  Canon wasn't interested in even offering video using their DSLRs, until their photojournalists convinced them--and they still weren't looking at the film making community.

If VFX and the film making community is crushed by OpenAI it'll be purely by accident.  And I don't think we can be accidently crushed. They'll do something stupid like not let you specify a framerate. They'll do something stupid like not train it on Anamorphic lenses.  They'll do something stupid like not let you specify shutter speed.  Because... it's not relevant to them. They aren't looking to create a film making took. The result is that it'll be soooooo close to amazing but simultaneously unusable for production because they just don't give a shit about us one way or another.

That's not to say there won't be a ton of content generated using AI.  The videographers shooting random shit for lifestyle ads... done.  Those clients don't give a shit, they just want volume.   But the videographers who know what looks good in a lifestyle ad and have the clients?  Now they can crank out even more videos for less.  They just won't be out there filming ""woman jogs down sidewalk by the ocean at sunset"" for getty, they'll be making bespoke unique videos for today's tiktok social.

Ultimately yes they have the **power** to destroy us call. But I have the **power** to get a kiln and pour molten lead inside of an anthill and then dig up the sculpture of my destruction.  But do I have the *motivation* to spend my time and money doing that? Nah.   The largest market is creating art/videos for randos on the street.  Those people are easily pleased. In fact, they don't want specificity because they aren't trained to know what they want.  Why spend billions of dollars creating weirdly specific tools for tailoring outputs when people just want ""Cool Image Generator"".  In fact I think they'll even have a hard time keeping people interested, because ""Cool Image Generator"" is already done by Instagram.

Ok-Use1684,"Posting here again if it helps to so many people panicking.

I have watched carefully all the video examples in that link.

My honest view: That's cool progress on stability. I think that's the only good thing to mention.

Now, the rest. There is a reason why this works only with text to video and they didn't want to go any further for now.

I'll explain: With that prompt: A cartoon kangaroo disco dances, you can clearly see that is some shot from a movie. The dance isn't a coincidence (nothing is) it's the exact dance or a very similar one from a specific shot.

The same happens with every single video example shown there. You would think it's an original generated video, but in fact it's just blended input. You can't go beyond the footage you used for training. Ever. Why? Because magic only exists in the Harry Potter world. Pure and simple. Let's be rational here. Spontaneous generation doesn't exist.

So that's fun and cool, for sure. But it is very limitated as a tool to use in any professional space. Because if you mention or say something that isn't in the training as input, you'll end up with miserable results, ignored prompts or you'll find yourslef fighting forever to get exactly what you want.

This is the problem with AI, it can only ""blend"" what it already knows. It's not a robot out there having human experiences and getting fresh inputs. And this leads you exactly to the following place: the more specific you are, the more AI will ignore you or give you miserable results. Go ahead and try it. See it for yourself.

So that is the opposite from what anyone working in production wants.

So you end up realising you're better off doing the thing yourself instead of trying forever or promising that ""maybe"" you'll get a damn simple little change you're being asked, because there isn't a damn input that allows you to get exactly what you want.

So this is, to me, nothing but a shiny and fun gimmick to use at home for entertainment.

Thats number one.

Number two, there is no intelligence behind it, no logic, no collisions, no rigged systems, no physical laws.. It's not a simulation. And it will never be, because it's not a damn Houdini or Maya solver working with physical laws. It's a input footage blender working with probability. So if you don't have specific inputs in the training with specific collisions and movements for what you're asking, you will always get weird intersections, non-logical face expressions or mouth/body movements, non-logical fire movement etc.

But it gets worse. Imagine every film production shuts down and no one ever uses a camera again. Where do you get new training from? Everything would look the same and be exactly the same.

Number three: Copyright issues. They can say whatever they want to say, but many trials are coming. And they will lose because they're simply using copyrighted content to train their models. India recently declared that AI developers can't use copytighted material without consent or compensation. Wait and see what happens in the rest of the world.

So what's the future of AI for VFX? Obviously tools to modify already existing outputs. Tools for us. Like these: (remove spaces)

Ok-Rock2345,"As someone who has had experience as a graphic designer, 3D enthusiast and am now dabbling in Stable diffusion, I don't think you should that worried.

Even though they would want you to think that creating a professional grade video is trivial and and any 5th grader could do it, that is very far from the truth. While AI can create some impressive images very quickly, the control you have over them is not even close to what you have with other tools.

For you to produce something good in AI up you need models that are trained for what you want, as well as some good prompting and understanding of what you are doing and the tools available. I lost count of how many images that I did that would have probably taken me a lot less time if I had just used Blender, or Photoshop, or crayons for that matter.

When you use Blender, you get EXATCLY what you want, provided you have the skills to achieve it. The same is not true with AI. Ninety-nine times out of 100 you will get an approximation of what you want, if you are lucky and have some skill. 

And even assuming that AI does take off and becomes more predictable, it will still need someone to come up with the ideas, and know how to describe them. As a designer, that should come easier to you than to some non-creative person.

In the end AI is just a tool. Powerful, yes, but just a tool. Much like a 3D rendering program. Believe it or not there was a time when people also thought that 3D computer graphics, Photoshop and even Deluxe Paint (if you want to go that far) were evil and going to end everyone's career.

Rosenvial5,">Real artists will keep making art because it is therapeutic for themselves. Nothing of value will be lost.

Exactly, I see so many artists, mostly people who draw anime and furry shit, who says it's going to be pointless or impossible to create art if they can't make money off it when AI leads to them getting fewer commissions.

And if someone is only concerned about making money and says they don't see the point in making art if they can't make money off it, then the art they create is only barely more valuable than what AI pumps out, because people who create art for the sake of the art itself will always exist.

There's a subset of artists who thinks that just because they call themselves an artist means they're part of some gilded class who thinks they should be able to make a living off their art full time, no matter the quality of their art or the demand. 

And the people who aren't part of this gilded class should keep scrubbing the toilets and sweeping the streets so this gilded class can keep creating art without needing to work a second job.",1708062596.0,41,This Sora AI stuff is awful,fredzpq9b,uct95avh,redscarepod
arimbaz,"- moore's law won't go on infinitely - you can't miniaturize semiconductors infinitely without hitting disruptive quantum effects. optimization can only take you so far. you're talking about tripling energy consumption and then optimizing half of that away? that's still a net gain in power draw.
- rare element scarcity, you still need to mine all of that lithium, cadmium, silicon etc. - that will get more and more expensive and prohibitive as we run out of cheap energy inputs to do the mining itself. also solar efficiency declines through the life of the panels - these will need to be replaced
- post-covid, geopolitical tensions are already eating into shipping and energy costs. watch that increase as land, water and resource conflicts continue to escalate through the century.

i'm not saying this technology will vanish entirely, but it will become expensive. the days of any noob office worker hopping onto ChatGPT to generate a bunch of copy for free will not last. you only have to look at netflix's ad and password sharing policies to see the contours of how a previously generous offering can be cut down to size over time.",1708047622.0,41,This Sora AI stuff is awful,fredzpq9b,f0jpjk7y9,redscarepod

VoloxReddit,"I mean, I think what worries me most about AI in general is:

* I don't see it creating new work. It's not like the industrial revolution or the car or whatever that may make some jobs unviable but create new ones. To me it seems like a tool used to extract the value produced by professional and non-professional artists, journalists, authors and others and provide it to a lucky few. We'll probably see a few openings for prompters and cleanup artists, but that'll be it.
* These last years have already shown us that a worrying amount of people lack basic media competency. If anyone can make a believable image or video with little to no investment of resources (be that time, money or skill), truth no longer exists on the internet. Warcrimes can be faked, or can be denied, depending on what they believe. We have already seen widespread use of AI ""documenting"" the Israel-Gaza conflict, for example, next to more traditional misinformation like misattributed footage.
* If human art were to no longer be competetive, I fear much of the creative industry will cease to exist, at least for a considerable length of time. Other industries will presumably suffer immensly too.

What does give me some hope:

* It seems genAI at this point has yet to prove profitable.
* There are ongoing lawsuits pertaining to copyright violations of various AI-companies. Many lawmakers have also expressed they feel AI-companies can't use copyrighted work to create their commercial products without fair compensation of the copyrightholders.
* With the mass amounts of AI data produced, eventually AI will not get around tainted data samples. Add to this anti-scraping methods like Glaze and Nightshade and maybe eventually AI will no longer be able to create results at an acceptable level of quality.

I think we as 3d artists have been fairly lucky so far, AI in 3d has been comparably minimal, and the 3d AI generators we have so far have not been especially competitive. I think this is mostly due to the relative inavailabilty of enough quality data to build good data sets, at least compared to 2d images. But with marketplaces like CGTrader stabbing artists in the back by selling their 3d models to AI companies, I expect it's only a matter of time before we feel the impacts of AI more intensly.",1708096663.0,40,Let's talk about Sora by OpenAI...,gtvbabsm,13jllx,blender

Ping-and-Pong,">end very soon

I doubt it. Like with nearly every other creative job right now, AI will act and does act as a fantastic tool to help you create what you want. But as of right now AI can not be used to replace someone creatively.

Take an AI written novel for example, they're awful. But use AI along with an experienced writer, and suddenly the writing can be improved upon what the writer could do before, and in less time.

Take an AI image as well. It's still normally somewhat uncanny, you can still normally tell, and even more so, the images themselves often aren't useful in great projects. However, take an artist working in photoshop with AI, they can use AI generated images as a base or extensions on their current photo, graphic, etc and suddenly AI is a great tool to make better things.

Concept art again. AI is a cool tool. But you can't create concept art from it. That normally needs stories and thought processes that as cool and helpful as these models are, they aren't able to replicate, especially, again, for larger projects. Can AI be a good base to start from? ABSOLUTELY. But it doesn't replace the job of a good concept artist in a project.

Then looking at these videos... Sure, they look like they could be great for stock videos in a youtube video. And that's super cool! But it's just that: Part of something, as a tool to make something greater again. On their own, they're cool, but they aren't *enough*. They are a tool to make something larger. AI isn't anywhere close to making a block buster film, because it doesn't have those capabilities and won't do for some time because that's such a complex concept to replicate. And even stock videos can be more specialised etc for a specific video, creation, whatever, than an AI can handle

Same will undoubtedly happen for 3D modelling therefore. AI will just be a tool for a long while. To help you with models, textures, whatever... But it can't completely *replace* a competent artist, because an artist isn't just about creating something, it's about creating something useful and meaning full. Something an AI can't understand *yet*.",1708104389.0,30,Let's talk about Sora by OpenAI...,gtvbabsm,664gjhtk,blender

flexaplext,"What's funny is that we are likely still drastically underestimating the magnitude of what we're witnessing.

All these breakthrough moments, they're not in isolation, they feed back into the ability to improve other models.


Sora and upcoming 'text to 3d model' models will help to start training 3d environments and simulations, which can be used to help train vision models, which can be helped to train language models and further video generation abilities, which feeds back into the entire system again, whilst also increasing the overall intelligence of AI which creates better ideas and prompting.


Soon enough, new abilities start arriving in these models just from increased capability. They can start recognizing bad paragraphs, single parts or features in an image / video and can go in directly to improve just those bad parts. Then they are able to keep going in, and in, and in ever improving the output through a repeated process of analysis and editing, much like we can do. This then makes these AI models more intelligent, video models even better, which feed back into the entire system again. They get better and better at self-analysis and recognizing faults as well as synthetic data generation.


Soon enough, more new abilities start to arrive. They get so intelligent that they start becoming exemplary at coding, new idea creation and overall system management. They begin being able to directly code themselves and help with ideas and efficiency improvements. They start helping with the progress of chip improvements, robotics, automation systems, mining techniques, energy harnessing. Technology progress expands, development time and scaling times start falling drastically, again feeding back into the system as a whole. Acceleration was already happening, but this puts acceleration on steroids.


This is how acceleration plays out, how we get to the point of the singularity. It is how things get so much better, faster than anyone really anticipates. It all starts with major breakthroughs like this. This is perhaps the 2nd one like such, after GPT-4, that will majorly feed into that self-improving system. It's the next link along that chain.

If that were a real thing? Then sure, maybe. However:

1) Gemini Ultra 1.0, which is what we have right now, has a 32k token context window:

[https://twitter.com/JackK/status/1756353408146317340](https://twitter.com/JackK/status/1756353408146317340)

2) 1.5, which we do not have yet, has a 128k token context window. We do have 128k context window available from OpenAI via the api.

3) The private preview you're referring to, and who knows when we will get that, has a 1 million token context window, or 8x what OpenAI has made available. Yes, this would be impressive, BUT:

4) The issues with Gemini Ultra have nothing to do with it running out of context. It sucks from the get go, struggling with simple requests. They will need to do a lot more than just increase its memory. Granted, they say that they are doing more (although they also say 1.5 performs the same as 1.0, so yuck), but we have no idea what that next generation actually looks like yet.

I think it will. Not that it will generate interesting thinking of its own volition, but that it will gradually co-opt and displace the space occupied by human thought. Slowly, like it has so far, with incremental progress that keeps people saying things like ""AI will never be good enough *for these particular standards*"", not noticing that the benchmark has shifted higher and higher with increasing technical quality.

Even the generative text was thought to be laughably outlandish 10 years ago. And everyone hasn't caught up to it penetrating the zeitgeist yet, but it will happen.

whistling_frank,"I wanted to share my perspective as someone to likely fit into the ""AI bro"" category.

I've been building AI/ML/NLP tools for the last 15 years. In the 2000s I worked on NLP tech to understand the meaning of news articles so we could offer a better news reading app for early smart phones. In those days, we had to build a ton of infrastructure, hire ontologists to build knowledge maps of the world, and at the end of the day the all we got out of it was the ability to diagram sentences (ah ha! the subject of this sentence is ""dog!"" I bet someone who likes dogs wants to read this!).

At the same time, I've been a hobbyist 3d-artist and indie game builder for even longer (I think Quake was the first game I built assets for.) I love how art and technology come together in 3d engines, and I love the process that brings together visual art, music, story telling, and algorithms. It's a massive amount of work, requiring expertise across dozens of domains, but the end result is beautiful.

Since my own most-honed skill is programming, I've always loved procedural generation- the technique of using algorithms to produce terrains, scenes, characters, etc. They extend the reach of my own tools, but they are also very limited. You can point them in a direction, but they will just replicate and remix without sufficient emergent complexity. This is why No Man's Sky can feel so repetitive despite being so expansive.

So when generative AI first poked its head out with Google's deep dream renderings, my imagination went wild. The prospect of dramatically lowering the cost and complexity of building dynamic 3D worlds is a dream to me. It means that small teams and inspired artists can build the thing they have in their heads. It's possible for the expanding digital world to be filled by individuals, not just giant corps with 1000s of people. If our entire experience of life is more and more mediated by digital tools (phones today, apple/meta headsets tomorrow), it's not OK if the starting price for sharing your idea has 7 figures.

But...

This is a major disruption. And it's a disruption on top of a long line of other cases of technology outpacing a lifetime of training, and honing, and love for a craft. And the disruptions are getting bigger, and affecting more people, and coming faster. The pace of technology is exponential, and intelligent systems will only accelerate it. It's disrupting the lives and jobs of ""AI bros"" too, even if they think that learning how to write a GPT prompt will save them while everyone else sinks below the water line.

What we need in the face of disruptive change is well run, representative government that can understand the change and set the guardrails that regulate giant tech companies, startups, and all the rest of us. Democracies, after all, exist to approximate the will of the people. We can't rely on corporations to make promises here any more than we can rely on similar promises to stem the progress of climate change. And even with that, I don't think there's a future where the development of intelligent systems would be stopped or even meaningfully slowed. Because even at the government level, competition between states incentivizes progressing as fast as possible toward bigger more powerful systems. Not because of conspiracies, but because the will of the people is usually more scared of foreign adversaries than it is of job disruption. (As an aside, keep an eye on things like the CHIPS act, TSMC, and the conflict with China over Taiwan. This geopolitical competition is happening in real time while NVIDIA rides the wave of capturing the global deep learning developer market.)

Dramatic change is both beautiful and scary at the same time, and your perspective changes everything. I hope to make tools that bring creative expression within reach of as many people as possible and that magnify the vision of skilled artists that understand the difference between expressing emotional truths and churning out garbage. For today at least, these tools are like water wheels: they sit inert until someone sends ideas flowing through. That means our ideas are still the most valuable resource we have.

Not a hater, just explaining how it works. I know many of us would be excited at the idea of remaking star wars with waifus, but that's simply not how an industry work.

Idk I think people are actually overreacting about ai art stuff. 

Mass media slop will always be pumped out and always change. 

And anyone who is worried about ai making music, for instance, hasn't actually heard music written by ai. It sounds so fucking horrible. It barely even works. 

I'm really not worried about ai stuff. It's a bunch of meaningless buzz and doomer shit. Based on unrealistic predictions. 

There is still symphony orchestras in every major city and in every university. 

You can look up videos of people in the late 80's using samplers and midi keyboards saying ""orchestras will be obsolete in the future"". 

That's kinda how I view people that are saying we will only listen to ai music in the future. It's just so ridiculous. People that don't understand art at all are saying these kinda things. 

It's kinda like the differences between playing a real piano and  a keyboard that's supposed to sound like a piano. We've already made the tech for keyboards to sound realistic.

So why do we still have pianos? Why doesn't everyone just get a keyboard? The difference is obvious.

JohnMundel,"Personally, I feel like the AI development course doesn't follow logic regarding the film making industry. On the very long term, maybe. But not really on the medium/long term. Let me explain my thoughts.

This technology has incredible abilities in pattern recognition, context recognition, ... Today, it is essentially used as a text to graphic media prompt, wether the output is an image or a video. This has some downsides:

-Directors, actors, VFX studios have developed a certain visual identity. Yes, it can be recognized as a pattern. But contrary to AI content, it evolves, because viewer is still looking for innovation, new things in his entertainment, especially in the streaming platform era. How can AI follow this trend for evolution and novelty outside of what has been done before? We'll see how it evolves. 

-Formalizing precisely what you want requires details, and production-wise, you still need to integrate the result to a professional workflow. It will take time to reorganize all the sector towards that, and thus probably money. Moreover, it's always a bit of a lottery, it remains hard to change small details on an already generated AI video. 

I wonder why they don't try to develop specialized AI for the professional workflow. At my beginner level I'd love a rigging AI that positions the bones by recognizing the organic shape of your creature, even if it is very unusual one, so you just need to do with your knowledge the delicate adjustments without spending time on the more basic stuff. Same thing with texturing, sculpting,... 

To sum up, I think AI could have a place in the workflow, providing it allows the best quality result and lesser organizational changes by easing the basic/intermediate stuff so you can spend time on the really advanced stuff and increase the final quality of your work.",1708092025.0,15,Let's talk about Sora by OpenAI...,gtvbabsm,9vkbi0d9,blender

TheBluestBerries,"You're completely missing the point. Do you have any idea how many iterations a high-end design goes through before it's approved? Hundreds, sometimes thousands of concepts.

Not just random concepts with a shotgun approach. The same concept over and over with constant minor changes dictated by a human overseer. Can you change this, can you adjust that. Very specific details.

Generators don't do specific. You give them a prompt, they spit something out. You either say 'good enough' or you don't. You can tell it to continue iterating on a selected image but at the end of the day, there's only a very clumsy level of control.

That's fine for low-end design where the designer-client relationship is based on ""just do whatever and I'm sure it'll be good enough"". But it doesn't work for any process where there's a clear idea that needs to matched exactly.

The fact that you can copy me is meaningless. All you're saying is that you weren't good enough to produce usable work of your own before AI.

I'm part of an initiative that trains people into using AI as part of their job. The project it mostly motivated to assuage fears that people will be replaced by AI by helping them work with AI. The main problem we see over and over is that when faced with a generator that can do almost anything people can think of... they can't think of anything.

Human creativity is a valued talent for a reason. And that's also why the main people who should be afraid of AI are the creatives who didn't actually have any creativity of their own.

One of my best friends is a storyboard artist who hasnt been able to work in months. I know many other creatives who are terrified their jobs arent coming back following the strikes because of job condensing. 

The power of AI is its ability to iterate quickly. The worry isnt removing everyone from the creative process, it's condensing roles and squeezing out the specialty people. 

Now an art department lead doesnt need a concept artist working for them, they can do it themselves. The previsualization department (for those who don't know: previz is basically a blocky animation, its like the step between a story board and a full animation) on a vfx heavy project can be 5-6 people plus a lead and a manager. These animations are not complex, theyre just showing range of movement with basic representations of the characters/props. These AI tools could condense this down to just the supervisor as the main previz person.

Blaize_Falconberger,">AI everything hits the same wall over and over again. It very effectively creates something that looks plausible at first glance. They're getting better and better with consistency at creating something with more and more self consistency**.** But as soon as you want to tweak anything at all it falls apart completely.

This is the most interesting bit of an interesting comment. I don't think people get it. The reason I think VFX as a whole is safe is because people don't understand how the AI works. And frankly, is it really AI? (no).

At its core this is still basically Chatgpt. It has a massive dataset and it's putting the word/picture most likely to be there based on its data set. It produces an output that looks impressive as long as you keep it reasonably vague and it's part of the dataset. You cannot make it adjust it's output to your specific intentions it just doesn't work like that. Something that does work like that will be a completely new/different AI. It cannot think for itself.

What is it's data set for ""Spiderman swings down from the rafters of the building and shoots webbing into two hoodlums eyes before turning round and seeing himself in a news report on the tv""? It's going to be complete gibberish no matter how many days you spend writing the prompt. and if the next scene is ""spiderman steps over the two hoodlums and jumps back into the rafters"" you're not going to get the same hoodlums, building, lighting, etc etc. You probably won't even get a spiderman that looks the same. 

There is a total lack of specificity built into the model, you can't get round that and you can't use it to make vfx if that is the case. It is making increasingly pretty pictures of generic things.

Disclaimer: when they release VfxNet_gpt next month I will claim an AI wrote all of the above.

heavy-minium,"That's quite the way to surprise us, given that the expectations weren't high when you look at their other products like Dall-E. It's not only state of the start, it blows everything else away!

From the top of my head, I can think of a few immediate implications:

* Visual novels made with those clips. Expect new experiences. I could also see Netflix doing nifty experiments here
* It's possible the idea could be applied in VR too in the future
* AR too! With some masking, you can make a virtual video avatar appear in your room - 60 seconds is enough for short interactions
* People will find ways too do erotic stuff with it and circumvent limitations - they will!
* Animated textures for video game development
* It can take a reference frame, so I guess we'll start to see more static images given life - especially image ads becoming video ads.
* Social media will be drowned with Sora generated clips
* But on the other side, we'll be gifted with many new creative web series productions and creative way to tell a narrative with short generated video sequences
* Video identification processes are probably not well prepared for this attack vector
* Propaganda content production on steroids
* More believable scams
* I think there will be a serious loss of jobs related to the creation of short video content or at least an hire-freeze and thus reduction of demand in the job market. With one person using those tools being as productive as many persons who don't, it's going to reduce the amount of jobs in that area. But then again, there will be even more short video content produced and consumed then ever, so maybe we can hope for a little counterbalancing.
* I believe prompt instructions alone are not reliable enough to maintain a style or distinct brand identity. The real gamer changer and job killer will be when (and if) they allow a form of fine-tuning.
* this + something like [NVlabs/neuralangelo: Official implementation of ""Neuralangelo: High-Fidelity Neural Surface Reconstruction"" (CVPR 2023) (github.com)](https://github.com/nvlabs/neuralangelo). 60s might be enough to ""scan"" the data of your imaginary world. While not a great quality, that could seriously speed up the workflow of a 3d modeller if they already prototype reference material to load into the tools they author their 3d models in. Ironically that might work better then text-to-3d models because there's already some video-to-3d out there that work poorly, and the solution here seems more capable and rich than any text-to-3d model so far. Also text-to-3d models need specialized models while here, it's almost like a unified model for short video creation of any type.
* My deepest condolecenses to you, RunwayML. You're probably dying out there.

In terms of the relevance for AGI as they claimed at the end of the announcement, I'm not fully conviced until they make a point of why it is so. Don't get me wrong, I'm excited, but I cannot see how it really helps in that particular aspect.

zeus55,"> but like damn maybe stop trying to draw anime or whatever and start pursuing greatness

The problem with this, is that artistic criticism/ppl being able to recognize what is good art seems to be at an all time low, and even worse critiquing a piece of media is actively discouraged by the ""let ppl enjoy things crowd"". 

I was talking to a guy who owns an AI based tech company about this very thing. I was bringing up how any AI art is just derivative of existing art, a copy of a copy, etc. and that once AI art becomes truly widespread, it will just be AI's copying from one another leading to a flattening of art and culture. His response was basically that you could increase the ""randomness"" parameters (not his words but i cant remember) in the AI model to create art that is truly novel and ""original"" but when you up the ""randomness"" parameter you usually end up with insane outputs, but he went on to say that it doesn't matter if it's insane/incomprehensible since you just have the AI regenerate the output a thousand times until it does spit out something that is actually a ""new"" piece of art. 

So I fear that the downstream effects of this is that AI art won't just replace mediocre artists (that's fine), it will make audiences as a whole stupider. A great artist could create truly great art but if no one of importance to an artists success (a teacher, potential customer, etc.) will be able to recognize it as great or it'll be such a small group that the artist can;t sustain themselves.",1708049719.0,12,This Sora AI stuff is awful,fredzpq9b,126k54,redscarepod

They cannot be ""creative"", in the sense of generating something entirely new, they can only associate words from a prompt with elements of the imagery they were trained on and generate an output based on that. In this dystopian future where everything has been replaced by AI, there will be nothing ""original"" left to train the models on. It will be ""out of ideas"", so to speak. 

People largely don't care how the sausage is made, true, but most can tell when something is mass-produced and profit-driven, vs. when actual thought and skill went into it. Marvel movies, Ubisoft releases, Machine Gun Kelly or whatever, there's already a prominent frustration with many people over certain types of media for being soulless and mass-produced. I imagive this will only increase in the short term, as greedy execs will absolutely be tripping over themselves to churn out as much shareholder-pleasing AI garbage as possible, before the novelty wears off. 

In the long term, I think VFX artists and artists in general will continue to exist. The way we work will probably shift quite massively as tools evolve to incorporate this tech.

HITWind,">I'm sorry, who wants this?

Literally everyone except artists who want or need to express themselves but they don't have the time or talent to dedicate to it.

Those who aren't creative in skill but might have things in mind that they need to express or envision, that don't have money for the tools or materials or the space to create or the time to create massive models or draw thousands of images for animations or can't hire the help or talent they need to realize something that only they can see in their minds. This isn't just something that will be used for blockbusters... Everyone will have access to this. Who cares about some studio and suit produced movie when families, hobby clubs, friends, fandoms, towns and states, everyone in between can easily express their stories in audio-visual format. Many people can't take center stage, or convey their vision effectively; Not everyone is attractive in the social scale, and not everything is easy to express with just words and the face you have, the talent you have. This will allow things like councelling sessions that used to require role-playing for movies to be made of how events were perceived. Political feuds could be negotiated as custom, purpose built stories and worlds. 

What you are witnessing is the invention of the telephone and the video phone, and you're saying ""Who want's this? Who is interested in removing human face-to-face contact from the interactions they enjoy?"" while typing away on the internet and communicating your thoughts with people far away that you know not who or where.

Odd-Road,">  The second a studio is spending millions for a product they want total and complete control over every aspect of the image

And that's where the logic of your point falters : the product will cost a lot less to produce.

I have been thinking for a while that we were relatively safe from AI because ""it requires precise input, and our clients' constant inability to make any call will be our saviour!""

But imagine that AI can output dozens of versions for the clients to pick. Clients can't make up their minds on anything, and some feel the need to comment and ask for changes just to justify their salary. And AI will soon be able to deliver just that, a bunch of BS versions so that the clients can pretend that this version is better than the previous one, all that at a minimal price, and at an incredible pace.

I was confident, but after seeing the Tokyo reflection video in the link, I feel that it's time to look for something else. 

Since I started working in the industry, I heard about work being about to be shipped to India or China, and I never worried about that, because they have huge studios, but also huge movie industries, and they're too far away from Hollywood in terms of time difference, etc.

Sora will probably never be used to make entire films. First they will probably use it for backgrounds, extras and not so on the nose stuff. But even then you still need to have a concept, director, editor, and someone to write a prompt. It will still require human work but you would need way less humans.

YouTube channel Corridor Crew already 2 short animes. First was 5min very wonky but it worked. Second one was 15min short anime and it looks almost fully legit. Both movies were made in mather of weeks with theam of 10ish people. Just few years ago you would need 50 people and months of work.

They made a ""how it's made"" video of a process. And you can clearly see that they had a lot of control over the process and full control over directing and story telling. Most of the heavy lifting for animating is done by AI, but still they had to add special effects. And most importantly they used free AI tools and none of them is anime animators, they are all VFX specialist. They made a point where now you can have a small dedicated crew for doing great things in a fraction of the time and costs. Last move they made was relised around 7 months ago. I could imagine that their next anime will be just as good as any traditionally made anime.

I think AI is not necessarily a bad thing, it's a tool like any other. The problem is that our economy is built around the idea that we all need to work full time jobs in order to earn money for living. There are few studies showing that we could easily work for 2-3 days a week and everything would work just fine, if we cut off bullshit jobs. For this to happen universal basic income has to be introduced and control over the accumulation of wealth by heavy progressive taxation, and control over the prices for the basic human needs like food, health, housing and education. David Graeber wrote a great book on this topic called Bullshit Jobs, and he wrote it before the AI boom. 

All these topics around will AI kill us all, is this the end of creativity, is this the beginning of a Matrix movie is pure bullshit, is just shitty spin off distraction narratives that is not allowing us to even imagine nice things that can be done with AI.

But a machine that can invent cheaper solar panels, or develop better government policies, or whatever it'll take, we're not there yet. Were you really expecting big tech to magically solve one of the biggest issues facing our generation overnight or something?

Image/video/text generation just turns out to be easier, and returns more on investment. Humans gain the ability to dream about waifus well before they gain the skills to tackle climate change. So in retrospect it's not too surprising that AI will take a similar path.

Or were you expecting AI to somehow learn how to save the planet without even learning to see, first? How can we expect a machine to learn to solve problems no human has been able to solve before (and no, everyone just deciding to do better isn't a solution) before it's learned trivial concepts like ""that glass fell, it will probably shatter"".

I suppose you'd have all that money spent on charity or human researchers. But that already happens. But people are betting more on the ""climate scientist in a box, also it makes me $$$"", and I think that makes sense.

IErsatzHawkChad,"Think about how much intention goes into a single shot in a film. Say you have an idea for a shot of someone's bedroom and you know exactly how you want it to look. To make that with AI it would require the AI to know about dimension, so you can plot the exact dimensions of the room you want. You'd then need it to know about perspective, so you can place your imaginary 'camera' exactly where you want it in the X Y and Z axes. You also want to have the option to tilt and rotate the camera on its own axis. The AI also has to know about lenses and focal lengths and how they interact with specific types of light, which means the AI also has to know about specific types of light. You obviously need all the decorative features of the room as well. 

Given that AI has no theory of world and doesn't actually understand what 'things' are as a concept, I'm pessimistic about it getting perspective and light down to a level where you can control it with prompts as well as you can just by pointing a camera and setting up lights. And if AI does progress to where it's possible to render a room in this fashion, it begs the question of whether writing down those measurements and values in such precise details and feeding them to a machine would be easier and more cost-effective than having an idea for a shot of a room, building the room, and taking the shot.

But maybe I'm stuck on the constraints of material filmmaking. Maybe the boon of AI is that you don't need to limit your imagination to things like cinematography and mise-en-scene. What about using AI to execute the ideas for filmmaking we haven't thought of yet, beyond the camera?

There's no way in hell it'll be more efficient to tell a text box ""move the camera down a little ... now back .... down more ... not that much ... ok back to the previous position .... no not that position the other one ... why is the back wall yellow now?"". Once I've used a prompt to vomit-draft a layout, I need to be able to reach into the scene and grab the camera and move it where the fuck I want and animate it with absolute specificity and there's no way in hell a text box is the right UI for that, regardless of image fidelity. I need to be able to grab different elements and plant them where they feel right in seconds, not in the time it takes to kinda sorta describe what I think and wait for the next render.

There are a lot of areas of art labour that are going to be reduced or eliminated, and my hope is that will actually turn out to be a good thing. Ultimately there will always be a need for specific tools to easily enable an artist to get their specific vision out of their head, and iteratively judge how each change makes them feel. My hope is that if there are fewer creative jobs, the jobs that remain are fun as hell and speak to the heart of why we love to tell stories in a rectangle.

I'll be using Sora day one, but with a text-box-only UI, I don't have high hopes for making anything more than ""cool"" shots and memes.",1708153857.0,9,Let's talk about Sora by OpenAI...,gtvbabsm,e4f3o,blender

kangdog,"Given a prompt interface it removes any desire for designers to struggle and master the skills and tools which are essential for human self confidence and self worth. The only way this is going to work (for the sake of all industries, film, vfx, ux design and software) is if the AI industry tone down the prompting and bring back visual programming interfaces that will empower designers and artists to exert their control over the model.

With a prompt interface we hand over control to a blackbox,  this lack of control will lead to mass media chaos. I'm glad OpenAI  haven't released this to the general public for free (yet) as they did with chatGPT. 

We need developers to wrangle this in and make it deeper and harder for people to master. 

Designers don't mind learning new tools but humans do care when all creative power is taken away from them. Think octane materials node editor, houdini visual programming and touch designer nodes.

cissybicuck,"Some people think that a simulation cant be conscious and only a physical system can. But they got it completely backward: a physical system cannot be conscious. Only a simulation can be conscious. Consciousness is a simulated property of the simulated self. - Joscha Bach

Atoms are having reactions to each other according to knowable laws.  Some of them have been involved in a particular kind of chemical reaction, oxidizing ATP, for about 4 billion years on this planet.  Those segments of the reaction that started running a simulation of their environment that included a self were more likely to be selected to continue burning ATP through generations of reproduction and eating.  So, yeah, we are in a simulation.  But it's not being run by any alien overlords from another dimension.  It's just a natural consequence of the makeup and physical laws of this universe.  It's pretty miraculous that this universe is the way it is.  But once it began as it did, everything that followed has been inevitable-- including the simulations we are currently generating and experiencing.  And through these simulations, atoms create music and laugh at jokes, and those things become characteristics of our universe.  Atoms in Texas probably never would have mixed up with atoms from Utah if it weren't for the simulations being run by two groups of atoms who met in a simulated social gathering place.  But a woman from Texas visited a man in Utah, and they kissed.  And that became a characteristic of our universe.  Simulations change the reality they reflect.

Jokong,"I am reading a book about John Von Neumann. He wrote a paper and developed a self replicating 2d automata in like the 50's before there was even a computer that could run it. 

His work from there led people to write programs with simple rules that left to 'evolve' created patterns and behaviors. These patterns and behaviors could supposedly, on a massive enough scale, create more complex patterns and behaviors. 

So one rule would be like if you have three binary digits in a row like 101, and that's a 'cell', then a rule would be zeros and ones can't  touch or both cells die. So that evolves into 010101010 etc. 

Make a second rule that the numbers are in groups of three and you have 'organisms' form. 000 101 111 110 001 010 and those 'live' in a 2d (line) obeying the two rules given to them. This creates patterns and behaviors. 

It also turns out that you can create through automata all the components you'd need to build a computer. Von Neumann was attempting to prove this when he wrote an automata that replicated. To replicate it had to be able pass down it's genetic info.

TheBluestBerries,"That process has been going on since the first man hit the first piece of flint with a rock. Keep in mind that there is skill, and creativity and muscle memory from sheer repetition.

I have worked in a lot of different media and when I think about my creative pursuits, I'm not thinking about endless hours crosshatching graphite, soldering leads, writing code, feathering oil paint or moving bezier curves and vertexes. When I look at AI tools I'm just thinking two things: that'll let me get *more* work done and that'll let me get more complex work done than I previously could.

At the end of the day, a more creative person will get better results from AI than an uncreative person. And when I'm doing paid work, I'm pretty results-oriented. If I can get my vision worked out as a result faster with AI, it just means I can go through more ideas in a week than I could before.

And I'm fine with that because it's an entirely different goal than I have for my personal creative pursuits. At home I photograph with analog film and develop my own photos. I tinker about with electronics to build simple robots. I do wood carving and I make woodblock prints. Because no amount of AI will take the pleasure of using my own hands to put my thoughts into reality.

So I don't feel threatened by AI at work and I don't feel threatened by AI as an artist. The people who are threatened are primarily the ones who, for a while, found a niche in knowing just enough to fool someone else into paying them for mediocre work.

mingkonng,"That's a good question.  

To preface, I am a 3d artist who went to school for 3d art while about 90% of my coworkers went to school for architecture and spent time working as architects before swapping their focus to renderings.  I am not an architect but I have heard a lot about what it is like to be one from my coworkers and friends.  This is to say my knowledge is second hand so take it with a grain of salt.  

About AIs impact - I think architecture will still need a lot of humans involved for the foreseeable future.  I think the job will get easier with these tools, same as any job specific AI assistant could make tasks easier, and it may end up cutting down on available positions in the long term, but, in my opinion, not as much as many other industries.  Generative AI is already making it's way into 3d concept designs for buildings.  AI to help with the more technical parts of how to build the structure, stress testing different iterations of design, is in the very early stages but it will be coming.  That said all of that will need to be generated, tweaked and quality checked by many real people.  I don't expect our construction laws to allow many corners to be cut in this regard.

As far as architecture as a career I've heard pretty much only bad things and I've heard a lot of it.  The 10,000' view of it to me is the ratio of school required to median pay in the industry is one of the worst I'm aware of.  The hours are long and not only for newbies.  It goes all the way up the chain unless you own the studio from what I've heard.  All of my colleagues were very happy with the decision they made to swap from being architects to focusing on the 3d rendering end of things.

There is so much overlap, it's insane.

A neural network is us taking what we have created so far and attempting to build the next component. 

All of this to say, emotions themselves are the same. They are something that can be converted to numerical data structures. Another way to confirm this is to look at philosophy.

mrcompositorman,"Generative AI is going to have a huge impact on the industry, and probably sooner than most of us would like. From my perspective at a large VFX studio, I think realistically there are a number of jobs that will get new tools to allow us to take on a larger volume or work, and also some areas where jobs will simply be replaced. This is what I'm seeing from the R&D that we're doing and the work our clients are interested in.

  
Jobs that will be replaced

If I was working in Roto/Paint right now, I could be extremely concerned. There's already extremely little artistic input in those types of tasks that benefit from having a human execute them, and I think it's very likely that paint/cleanup will become almost entirely AI generated within a year or two, if not sooner. Rotoscoping is a bit more complex, and I think that it may take a little bit longer for a program to be able to generate consistent, usable splines with motion blur that can be used downstream. Likely there will always be very complex cases where a person needs to be involved. But I think in general, studios will jump on the opportunity to push as many of these kind of jobs to AI as they can. 

The other thing that I think will likely be disappearing very quickly is stock video and stock elements. Why pay for stock videos when you can generate exactly what you want? 

Jobs that will get new tools

Concept artists will likely be asked to lean into AI to more quickly come up with initial concepts. I've already seen this happening on a number of jobs, with AI being used to very quickly concept and then once we pick the aspects of designs that we like, the concept artist takes it from there and brings it home. 

I think it's very likely that we'll see AI render engines. Lighting/shading will very likely be given new tools to generate images, which I think will work very similarly to physics based renderers today - just using generative AI to make the final images instead of a physics based equation.

We're already using AI to assist with rigging, setting up a basic structure that artists can then work with and refine. 

Summary

At the end of the day, AI is a tool that still needs someone to push buttons. For those of us already working in the industry, I think it's been a trend for years now that animation and visual effects have become more and more approachable. Software has gotten more user-friendly, there are amazing free tools now like Blender, and Resolve. With the massive demand for animation and visual effects, I doubt that AI will actually eliminate that many jobs. More than likely it will allow existing companies to take on significantly more work and, hopefully, deliver higher quality results. And I think there are a number of industries that will simply refuse to engage with AI. Motion capture has been around for decades and Disney still proudly hand-animates every one of their films. You have a larger movement of filmmakers wanting to avoid CGI, and I guarantee they'll just as aggressively want to avoid AI. The industry is growing and changing, like it always does.

I think that era is going to be short lived if you're talking about conventional movies.  The era after that is where it gets crazy.  

An AI Star Wars movie as a conventional movie would be where producers/creators of some type manage the process and release a finished product that is viewed consistently the same each time.

The next era will be entirely generative and unique to input from each viewer:

* Hey Sora, create a movie in the Star Wars universe where Han Solo would not only shoot first, but is sociopathic about it.
* Hey Sora, create a Star Wars origin story movie about the Storm Trooper who bumps his head while walking into the control room on the Death Star.
* Hey Sora, create a Star Wars movie where Storm Troopers are able to hit what they're shooting at.

Weaves87,"Beyond OpenAIs aggressive hiring, one of the key things about machine learning (AI) especially as it pertains to LLMs like ChatGPT, is that they can use it to expedite training future versions.

Its against their ToS, but you see evidence of this in open source models (like Mistral and others) that reached GPT 3.5 level output so quickly. And no doubt OpenAI leverages this technique as well. 3.5 was probably used to help train 4, and GPT4 can help assist for whatever comes next.

AI training AI is a bit of a meme, and a scary one at that, but with human oversight you can expedite a lot of the process for filtering and optimizing the data in order to get a specific result, because LLMs can work far faster than humans can when processing mass amounts of information, with reasonable accuracy.

LLMs specialize in language, but everything on the internet is a language. Even videos, represented as a series of bytes representing a visual idea.

TheOnionKnigget,"Why is it ""targeting"" to develop something that can produce monotonous but required work? I understand that it could come to *impact* you, but that is different from *targeting*. Was the invention of the power loom ""targeting"" weavers or was it just an invention with a better value proposition.

The weavers were also [quite upset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-loom_riots) but as we all know, handloom weaving is not a very popular career path at the moment. In another comment you mention wanting to ban AI outright. Do you also think we should decommission  textile factories to artificially deflate supply, make hand looms economically viable, and charge hundreds of dollars for a single shirt to offset the costs of labor? 

It seems a silly idea to propose, choosing to pay so much for ""just a shirt"", while also encouraging people to do tedious manual labor.

Weaving was absolutely considered an art. What is different now? As long as we have a capitalist society (without a UBI solution) any work that could be replaced with current technology at a cheaper cost with equal or higher quality is artificial work. If AI were to be banned would you actually still feel good about the work you do? 

Would you not feel a bit odd about hand weaving a fabric for 80 hours and getting paid $2000 while fabric of the same quality can be produced at the power loom right next to you at a tenth of that price?

DonutsMcKenzie,">Why do that when its completely legal to scrape data? 

It's not a question of whether they can scrape the data or not, it's a question of whether they can use that data to train an AI.

>Well see what the law says pretty soon I suppose. The whole concept of whether something is stealing/plagiarizing is a legalese idea that can only be decided in court. We can discuss it philosophically but theres no objective truth to it tbh. 

Images, video, songs, articles and even comments could all be consider copyrighted works. So the question is whether training generative AI is considered ""fair use"" of those copyrighted works or not.

Protection of copyrighted works is the law and ""fair use"" is the exception.

Fans of AI like to pretend that machine learning and human learning are the same thing and that they are both automatically fair use, but neither of those things are true. OpenAI and the other companies ""stealing"" all of the creative works will have to make the argument that what they're doing is genuinely ""fair use"".

>The reality is they already won, even if it becomes illegal the tech is good enough they could produce the data to train a new model. Theres foreign countries that will do it regardless. Plus theres open source models.

I don't think anyone cares if they produce their own data to train their own model. People really only care that their work is being used without any form of consent, attribution or license by companies that are, in many cases, for-profit and mega rich. Most artists that I know would be happy to collect a few thousand bucks a month for the use of their artwork in AI training, or whatever. It's the exploitation of their work that bothers people, and it should bother everyone.

Whether foreign countries respect copyright or not is old hat too, by the way. If you walk down the street in certain parts of Asia you'll see people selling endless mountains of unlicensed bootleg merchandise. Those people can't legally do business in countries where copyright is upheld, so it's really a separate market altogether for the most part. I have no doubt that AI exploitation will run rampant in some parts of the world, but I'm mainly concerned with what happens in places with robust copyright laws.

Of course you can't stop people from training their own model with FOSS, but that's up to the individual whether they want to play games with copyrighted stuff. Most for-profit companies will avoid that kind of legal liability, if it turns out that generative AI isn't fair use, that is.

>And a technologies usefulness or advancement isnt dependent on public sentiment luckily so idc about that. The reality is autonomous taxis are expanding (Waymo for example), autonomous trucks are improving and sooner or later despite Musks awful predictions, it will become a reality.

vix86,"If we're talking about the entire generative AI sphere as a whole -- ChatGPT, DALLE/StableDiffussion, and now this(SORA) -- I'd say its too early days to say just exactly where it'll be positively impactful. It'll *definitely* be negatively impactful, but then that has been the case for just about every tech advance.

Right now, I'd say this tech is like getting your hands on an electric circular saw before electricity is wide spread. There are very specific places you can go to use the saw, but who the fuck wants to use the saw at the shop that's trying to sell it to you.

All the carpenters are looking at it and going, ""Eh, I can see where it might be useful, but I need electricity and a constant supply of new blades"" while also not realizing that motors can just die as well.

My guess? Mainstream people will see this tech get integrated in subtle ways into stuff they already enjoy. They may not even realize its being used either, it'll just appear as if further ""depth"" has been added to some kind of interactive content that use. 

Outside of the mainstream, particularly with this SORA, it'll probably give an avenue for some people to create content that they feasibly never could have due to various limiting factors.

I could also see detrimental issues arising around learning defects with children that get drowned with generated content. We'll need to introduce a minimum age.

With kids getting less out of the house and learning more from digital content, it will be hurting their capacity to correctly learn real-world concepts until we fix this.

MrPhraust,"So this worries me too. Damn does it. But. I have to remind myself - can Sora make the model, make sure clean topology, unwrap with minimal seams, etc? Not yet. I bet topology of these models is real shit when it comes down to it.

Here is a scenario: A member of a dev team uses Sora for a very specific project idea. They are making a game and need some vehicles. Sora spits out the most beautiful cars in just seconds. But wait. That cars dont have the required details. 

They ask Sora to change up a wheel here, change a door or two there, add a storage bin here, extrude out the cars side there, add air intakes on hood.

Ok - ask for those changes - how good do you think the topology of that final model is? Is it unwrapped properly? Welded? Proper seam cuts?

AI will give us a close approximation, but the details the fine care, the talent of near flawless creation on all those levels, the attention to the details - AI still fails hard.

I feel even Sora is a ways from that. We have lbs for awhile longer.

And when it does come full force, maybe it will augment abilities instead of replace them.

AI doesn't generate ""composition of other people's art"" any more than a flesh artist does. It breaks its dataset down into patterns, abstractions and connections in the training stage, and stores that data within itself. Then it draws onto its store of patterns to generate an image as prompted by user.

It's very hard to make it actually ""memorize"" an entire image - and this usually happens to images that happen to be overrepresented in the dataset. For example, it's common for an AI model to be able to generate a very close copy of Mona Lisa - because there are thousands of variations of it in images all across the net, and it was able to memorize it very well.",1711234321.0,3,OpenAI is pitching Sora to Hollywood.,w21m7,lhw3a,technology

The difference here is that no previous invention was able to simulate human thought and creativity.

There has never been a new technology that could create an economy, where *the technology itself could handle the workload required in that economy*.  The ""new jobs"" created, could simply be automated by the AI - maybe not immediately, but probably within a short period of time.

And if the abilities of this tech continue to expand at an exponential rate, by this time next year, all of Hollywood could be in serious trouble.  And not just directors and highly paid actors, but think about all of the people who have catering companies who provide food for movie sets.  Consider the carpenters and electricians who also build, repair, and provide other services for film studios.  There is an entire economy built around just this one industry.

I don't think the market will go away completely, but it will dramatically shrink the pool of potential clients in a few years when the price of Sora becomes reasonable for buyers and the technology becomes good enough for most of their needs. Clients won't need to pay royalties for stock footage or shell out hundreds/thousands for a several specific b roll shots. If the price of Sora is $300 or $400 a month in 5 years, a lot of small and medium sized businesses will opt for that option over spending a similar (or in some cases much greater amount). Add onto the fact that a $300 or $400 videographer price would be just for a singular 60 second video, while a Sora subscription could output multiple 60 second videos without a price increase. Even if Sora were limited to 1 video per week, which it won't be, that's still 4 minutes of footage for only $300.

Their story as a human being and the roads theyve gone down creatively are what make their art special to me.

Which is actually the furthest thing from the truth. SAG, the biggest media union in Hollywood has clauses in their contract for this exact purpose. 

I mentioned copyright for a reason, all Hollywood is copyrighted. If you use tools sure, you can get around that law because a human edited it and did most of it not all the work.

WarAndGeese,"It's not a traditional industry though where people just buy the cheapest reliable version of the product. Hence I don't think it makes sense for them to have to worry about overseas labour. Regarding neural networks it's the same as with computer generated graphics, they will conitnue to use them and the capabilities will increase over time, but at least over the next few decades people like seeing real live people acting.

People tend to set their minds on certain IP, certain writers, certain actors, and the styles of those people. Hence if you created some movie out of Vietnam that was objectively better, but with a director nobody has never heard of with the exact same style as Christopher Nolan, with a story about a Marvel-like superhero, with actors that are very similar to big-name ones but that nobody knows, then there is big resistance to go watch it. Since these preferences develop over decades it takes a while for people to just switch to the next cheapest product, like for mainstream Western society to start watching Bollywood or Chinese movies and to actually prefer it.

If it were a traditional product then it would be a valid concern, but since so much relies on preferences of people that have built up over decades, shows that they grew up watching, and people that they grew up admiring, the studios have a lot of freedom and a lot of 'rent'-style money that the can continue to make.",1711174084.0,1,OpenAI is pitching Sora to Hollywood.,w21m7,an5jpza,technology

WarAndGeese,"I wonder how people are going to solve those problems with neural networks. I think that they will but I'm not sure how yet. With image generation you can basically just keep generating images, and then keep generating sections of images. You can delete the portion you don't like, then describe it better, and then have the model fill in the part with in-painting. You can also feed in existing images to make sure that the generations match that style. Basically you can start creating an image with a style and have the neural network fill out the rest of the content, and again with deleting and inpainting and coming up with new descriptions you can keep editing the image until you get what you want. With video I'm not sure how this will work. Will models be able to be given styles and videos, and simply just be asked to continue into the next scene? I was surprised that their solution for video wasn't to create a coherency between frames but instead to just feed in entire videos and have it generate entire videos.
