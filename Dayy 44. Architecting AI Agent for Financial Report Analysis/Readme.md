# 💰 Architecting AI Agents for Financial Report Analysis [(Colab Link)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1spn5sQQgKfkRfI8lZ47bgbbIyRBYQeLV)

## 🌟 Project Overview  

In the ever-evolving world of **finance**, data is everything. But **manual financial analysis is slow, prone to bias, and inefficient**. This project introduces a **revolutionary AI-driven system**—a team of **four autonomous AI agents** designed to:  

✅ **Conduct deep financial research** with real-time web search  
✅ **Retrieve financial insights** from reports using **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**  
✅ **Analyze stock market data in real-time** for investment decisions  
✅ **Evaluate AI-generated financial reports** using **LLM-as-a-Judge**  

### **🚀 What This Project Achieves**  
This isn't just another chatbot. **These AI agents work together** to provide a **scalable, data-driven solution** for financial professionals, helping them make **faster, more informed decisions**.

## 🏗️ AI Agent Architecture  

💡 The project consists of **four specialized AI agents**, each with a specific financial intelligence role.  

### **📚 Agent 1: Research & Web Search AI**  
🔹 Retrieves the **latest financial news & reports** from the web  
🔹 **Fact-checks** and **summarizes** key financial insights  
🔹 Generates **comprehensive financial briefings**  

### **🔎 Agent 2: RAG-Powered Financial Knowledge Extractor**  
🔹 Uses **PgVector** to store and retrieve financial documents  
🔹 Enables **semantic search** over **thousands of financial reports**  
🔹 Provides **instant, document-based financial Q&A**  

### **📈 Agent 3: Stock Market Analyst AI**  
🔹 Uses **Yahoo Finance API** for **real-time stock & market analysis**  
🔹 Analyzes **earnings reports, growth metrics, and market sentiment**  
🔹 Generates **investment-grade financial insights**  

### **⚖️ Agent 4: AI-Based Report Evaluator (LLM-as-a-Judge)**  
🔹 Uses **self-reflection techniques** to assess financial reports  
🔹 Evaluates reports based on **accuracy, completeness, and clarity**  
🔹 Helps investors **validate AI-generated insights**

## 🔥 AI Agent Workflow  

📌 The four AI agents work **seamlessly together** to generate, analyze, and evaluate financial data.  

**1️⃣ User asks a financial question** → **Research AI retrieves data**  
**2️⃣ RAG AI extracts key insights from financial documents**  
**3️⃣ Stock AI provides real-time stock market analysis**  
**4️⃣ AI Judge evaluates & validates the generated report**
