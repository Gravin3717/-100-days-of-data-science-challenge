## üéØ Project Goal: From Raw Sales Data to Automated Business Insights

Welcome to Day 97 of my #100DaysOfDataScience challenge! This project focuses on analyzing bicycle sales data spanning multiple years and automating the delivery of key sales insights directly to a Slack channel.

**Objectives:**

- Aggregate and analyze historical sales data to uncover monthly trends and top-performing sales staff.
- Automate the generation and posting of a concise, formatted sales update message to a Slack workspace.
- Demonstrate integration of data analysis with communication tools for real-time business reporting.

## üìä Data Analysis Workflow

1. **Data Loading & Preparation:**
    - Joined orders and order items datasets to create a comprehensive sales DataFrame.
    - Calculated total sales per order item as `quantity * list_price * (1 - discount)`.
    - Aggregated total sales by month to observe trends over time.

2. **Monthly Sales Trend Visualization:**
    - Generated a time series of total monthly sales.
    - Observed seasonal fluctuations and growth patterns from 2016 through early 2018.

3. **Top Sales Staff Identification:**
    - Grouped sales data by staff member.
    - Calculated total sales attributed to each staff.
    - Identified top three performers for April 2018.
