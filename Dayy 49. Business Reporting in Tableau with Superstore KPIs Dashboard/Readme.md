### **2. State-Level Insights**
- Texas leads in profitability across regions but shows slower sales growth compared to Michigan.
- Michigan recorded the highest sales ($11,490), indicating strong customer engagement in this state.
- States like Wisconsin and South Dakota exhibit minimal activity, representing untapped market potential.

### **3. Category and Sub-Category Insights**
