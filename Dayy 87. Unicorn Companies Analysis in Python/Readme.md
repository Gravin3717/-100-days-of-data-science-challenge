# 🦄 Day 87 – Unicorn Companies Analysis in Python

Welcome to **Day 87** of my coding journey!  
In this project, I dive deep into the fascinating world of **Unicorn Companies** — privately held startups valued at over **$1 billion**. Using **Python**, **pandas**, and **visualization libraries**, I analyze company valuations, founding patterns, funding stages, industries, and global distributions to uncover valuable business insights.

## 📚 Project Summary

**Goal**:  
Analyze key trends in unicorn companies to understand:
- Which industries and regions are producing unicorns
- How valuations differ by industry and geography
- How funding stages impact valuation
- How startup timelines to unicorn status are shrinking

**Skills Practiced**:
- Data cleaning and wrangling
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Building insightful, attractive visualizations
- Business intelligence storytelling

## 📊 Workflow Overview

### 1️⃣ Data Loading and Initial Exploration
- Import dataset into pandas
- Inspect column names, data types, and missing values
- Parse `Valuation` and `Date Joined` columns into usable formats

### 2️⃣ Data Cleaning
- Remove dollar signs (`$`) and "B"/"M" suffixes to convert `Valuation` into floats
- Parse dates into proper `datetime` format
- Handle missing values (e.g., unknown funding stages)

### 3️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Top industries producing unicorns
- Top countries and cities by unicorn count
- Average valuation by industry
- Funding stage distribution among unicorns
- Time between founding year and unicorn year ("speed to unicorn")

### 4️⃣ Visualization
- Pie charts, bar charts, line plots
- Trend analysis over time (yearly unicorn growth)
